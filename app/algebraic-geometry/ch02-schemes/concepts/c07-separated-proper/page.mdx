# Separated and Proper Morphisms

Separated and proper morphisms are fundamental notions in scheme theory that generalize topological concepts of Hausdorff and compact spaces. These properties ensure good geometric behavior and are essential for many theorems in algebraic geometry.

## The Diagonal Morphism

The key to understanding separatedness is the diagonal morphism, which measures how uniquely points are determined.

<Definition id="diagonal-morphism" title="Diagonal Morphism">
Let $f: X \to S$ be a morphism of schemes. The **diagonal morphism** is the unique morphism
$$\Delta_{X/S}: X \to X \times_S X$$
induced by the universal property of the fiber product, corresponding to the pair of identity morphisms $(1_X, 1_X): X \to X$.

Explicitly, $\Delta_{X/S}$ is defined by the commutative diagram:
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
X & \xrightarrow{\Delta_{X/S}} & X \times_S X \\
& \searrow & \downarrow \\
& & S
\end{array}
$$
where both compositions $X \to X \times_S X \to X$ equal $1_X$.
</Definition>

<Remark>
The diagonal morphism sends each point $x \in X$ to the point $(x, x) \in X \times_S X$. The image of $\Delta$ is called the **diagonal** in $X \times_S X$.
</Remark>

<Example id="diagonal-in-variety" title="Diagonal in Affine Space">
Consider $f: \mathbb{A}^2_k \to \operatorname{Spec} k$ over a field $k$. Then $\mathbb{A}^2_k \times_k \mathbb{A}^2_k \cong \mathbb{A}^4_k$ with coordinates $(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2)$.

The diagonal morphism $\Delta: \mathbb{A}^2_k \to \mathbb{A}^4_k$ is given by:
$$(x, y) \mapsto (x, y, x, y)$$

The image of $\Delta$ is the closed subscheme of $\mathbb{A}^4_k$ defined by the ideal $(x_1 - x_2, y_1 - y_2)$, which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^2_k$.
</Example>

<Example id="diagonal-affine-scheme" title="Diagonal for Affine Schemes">
Let $X = \operatorname{Spec} A$ and $S = \operatorname{Spec} R$ with $f: X \to S$ corresponding to a ring homomorphism $\varphi: R \to A$.

Then $X \times_S X = \operatorname{Spec}(A \otimes_R A)$, and the diagonal morphism corresponds to the multiplication map:
$$m: A \otimes_R A \to A, \quad a \otimes b \mapsto ab$$

The kernel of $m$ is the ideal $I$ generated by elements of the form $a \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes a$ for $a \in A$. The diagonal is the closed subscheme $\operatorname{Spec}(A) \subseteq \operatorname{Spec}(A \otimes_R A)$.
</Example>

## Separated Morphisms

<Definition id="separated-morphism" title="Separated Morphism">
A morphism of schemes $f: X \to S$ is **separated** if the diagonal morphism
$$\Delta_{X/S}: X \to X \times_S X$$
is a closed immersion.

A scheme $X$ is **separated** if the structural morphism $X \to \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}$ is separated.
</Definition>

<Remark>
The separatedness condition is the scheme-theoretic analogue of the Hausdorff property in topology. In a Hausdorff space, distinct points can be separated by disjoint open sets. For schemes, separatedness means the diagonal is closed in the product.
</Remark>

### The Hausdorff Analogy

<Example id="hausdorff-diagonal" title="Hausdorff Spaces and the Diagonal">
For a topological space $X$, the space is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal $\Delta = \{(x, x) : x \in X\} \subseteq X \times X$ is closed.

**Proof**: If $X$ is Hausdorff and $(x, y) \notin \Delta$ (so $x \neq y$), there exist disjoint open sets $U, V$ with $x \in U$ and $y \in V$. Then $U \times V$ is an open neighborhood of $(x, y)$ disjoint from $\Delta$. Thus the complement of $\Delta$ is open.

Conversely, if $\Delta$ is closed and $x \neq y$, then $(x, y) \in (X \times X) \setminus \Delta$, which is open. This open set contains a basic open $U \times V$ with $x \in U$ and $y \in V$, separating $x$ and $y$.
</Example>

### Basic Properties

<Theorem id="separated-properties" title="Properties of Separated Morphisms">
1. Affine morphisms are separated.
2. Closed immersions are separated.
3. The composition of separated morphisms is separated.
4. Separatedness is stable under base change.
5. If $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to S$ are morphisms with $g \circ f$ separated and $g$ separated, then $f$ is separated.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
We prove (1) and (4), leaving others as exercises.

**(1)** Let $f: X \to S$ be affine, so $X = \operatorname{Spec} A$ for some quasi-coherent $\mathcal{O}_S$-algebra $A$. Then $X \times_S X = \operatorname{Spec}(A \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} A)$, and the diagonal corresponds to the multiplication map $A \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_S} A \to A$, which is surjective. Its kernel defines a closed subscheme, hence $\Delta$ is a closed immersion.

**(4)** Given a base change $S' \to S$, we have $(X \times_S X) \times_S S' \cong (X \times_S S') \times_{S'} (X \times_S S')$. The diagonal morphism for $X \times_S S' \to S'$ is the base change of $\Delta_{X/S}$. Since closed immersions are stable under base change, the result follows.
</Proof>

<Example id="affine-schemes-separated" title="Affine Schemes are Separated">
Any affine scheme $X = \operatorname{Spec} A$ is separated over $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}$.

The fiber product $X \times X = \operatorname{Spec}(A \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} A)$, and the diagonal corresponds to multiplication $A \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} A \to A$. The kernel is generated by $a \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes a$, which cuts out a closed subscheme isomorphic to $X$.
</Example>

<Example id="projective-space-separated" title="Projective Space is Separated">
Projective space $\mathbb{P}^n_S$ over any scheme $S$ is separated over $S$.

The key observation is that $\mathbb{P}^n_S$ can be covered by affine open subschemes $U_i \cong \mathbb{A}^n_S$, and on overlaps $U_i \cap U_j$, the transition maps are given by Laurent polynomials, which define closed immersions on appropriate affine patches.

The diagonal $\Delta: \mathbb{P}^n_S \to \mathbb{P}^n_S \times_S \mathbb{P}^n_S$ can be shown to be a closed immersion by checking on the standard affine open cover.
</Example>

## Non-Separated Schemes

<Example id="line-doubled-origin" title="The Line with Doubled Origin">
The canonical example of a non-separated scheme is the **line with doubled origin**.

**Construction**: Start with two copies of the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1_k = \operatorname{Spec} k[t]$. Call them $U_1 = \operatorname{Spec} k[t_1]$ and $U_2 = \operatorname{Spec} k[t_2]$.

Remove the origin from each: let $V_1 = \operatorname{Spec} k[t_1, t_1^{-1}]$ and $V_2 = \operatorname{Spec} k[t_2, t_2^{-1}]$ be the punctured lines.

Glue $U_1$ and $U_2$ by identifying $V_1 \cong V_2$ via the isomorphism $t_1 \mapsto t_2$.

The resulting scheme $X$ is the line with doubled origin. It has two points $0_1 \in U_1$ and $0_2 \in U_2$ that both "look like" the origin, but they remain distinct in $X$.

**Why it's not separated**: Consider the diagonal $\Delta: X \to X \times_k X$. The two points $(0_1, 0_2)$ and $(0_2, 0_1)$ in $X \times_k X$ lie in the closure of the diagonal (since points near the origins can be paired), but they are not actually on the diagonal itself (since $0_1 \neq 0_2$ in $X$).

More precisely, the diagonal is not closed because its complement contains points that are limits of diagonal points but not themselves diagonal.
</Example>

<Example id="doubled-origin-explicit" title="Explicit Non-Separatedness of Doubled Origin">
Let $X$ be the line with doubled origin. Consider the fiber product $X \times_k X$.

The complement of the diagonal consists of points $(x, y)$ where $x \neq y$ in $X$. However, the points $(0_1, 0_2)$ and $(0_2, 0_1)$ are in the closure of this set (topologically), yet they represent distinct points that "should" be separated but aren't.

If we consider a morphism from $\operatorname{Spec} k[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2)$ to $X$ sending the closed point to $0_1$ and the generic point into the common part, and another sending the closed point to $0_2$, we get a morphism to $X \times_k X$ whose image approaches the "non-diagonal" points $(0_1, 0_2)$.

This violates the Hausdorff-like property: we cannot separate the two origins.
</Example>

<Example id="non-separated-gluing" title="General Non-Separated Gluing">
More generally, take any scheme $Y$ and two copies of it, $U_1$ and $U_2$. Let $V \subseteq Y$ be an open subscheme, and identify $V \subseteq U_1$ with $V \subseteq U_2$.

If $V \neq Y$, the resulting scheme $X$ obtained by gluing $U_1$ and $U_2$ along $V$ is typically not separated, as points in $Y \setminus V$ appear with multiplicity.
</Example>

## Proper Morphisms

Proper morphisms combine separatedness with a compactness-like condition.

<Definition id="proper-morphism" title="Proper Morphism">
A morphism of schemes $f: X \to S$ is **proper** if it satisfies:
1. $f$ is of finite type,
2. $f$ is separated, and
3. $f$ is universally closed (for any base change $S' \to S$, the morphism $X \times_S S' \to S'$ is a closed map on underlying topological spaces).

A scheme $X$ over a field $k$ is called a **complete variety** if $X \to \operatorname{Spec} k$ is proper.
</Definition>

<Remark>
The condition "universally closed" cannot be replaced by just "closed" because closedness may fail after base change. Universal closedness is the correct scheme-theoretic generalization of compactness.
</Remark>

### Topological Analogy

<Example id="proper-compact-hausdorff" title="Proper = Compact + Hausdorff">
In topology, a continuous map $f: X \to Y$ between locally compact Hausdorff spaces is **proper** if $f$ is closed and preimages of points are compact.

For schemes, proper morphisms play the same role:
- **Separated** corresponds to Hausdorff (diagonal is closed),
- **Universally closed** corresponds to compactness (preimages are "compact"),
- **Finite type** ensures reasonable fibers.

Just as compact Hausdorff spaces have excellent properties in topology, proper schemes have excellent properties in algebraic geometry.
</Example>

### Basic Examples

<Example id="finite-morphism-proper" title="Finite Morphisms are Proper">
Any finite morphism $f: X \to S$ is proper.

Finite morphisms are affine and of finite type, hence separated. They are also universally closed because the image of a closed set under $\operatorname{Spec} B \to \operatorname{Spec} A$ (where $B$ is a finite $A$-algebra) is closed, and this property is preserved under base change.
</Example>

<Example id="closed-immersion-proper" title="Closed Immersions are Proper">
Any closed immersion $i: Z \to X$ is proper.

Closed immersions are separated, of finite type, and universally closed (being closed maps that remain closed under base change).
</Example>

<Example id="projective-space-proper" title="Projective Space is Proper">
The morphism $\mathbb{P}^n_S \to S$ is proper for any scheme $S$.

We've already seen that $\mathbb{P}^n_S$ is separated over $S$. It's clearly of finite type (it has a finite cover by affine schemes, each of finite type over $S$).

The universal closedness is the deepest part: this is essentially the classical theorem that the image of a projective variety under a regular map is closed (after taking into account all base changes).
</Example>

<Example id="projective-morphism-proper" title="Projective Morphisms are Proper">
A morphism $f: X \to S$ is **projective** if it factors as $X \xrightarrow{i} \mathbb{P}^n_S \xrightarrow{\pi} S$ where $i$ is a closed immersion.

Since closed immersions and $\mathbb{P}^n_S \to S$ are proper, and properness is preserved under composition, every projective morphism is proper.

This is one of the most important sources of proper morphisms in algebraic geometry.
</Example>

## Properties of Proper Morphisms

<Theorem id="proper-composition" title="Stability Properties of Properness">
1. Properness is preserved under composition.
2. Properness is preserved under base change.
3. Properness is local on the base (if $f: X \to S$ is such that $f^{-1}(U_i) \to U_i$ is proper for an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $S$, then $f$ is proper).
4. If $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to S$ are morphisms with $g \circ f$ proper and $g$ separated, then $f$ is proper.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
These follow from the corresponding properties of the constituent conditions (finite type, separated, universally closed). The key point is that each condition is stable under the relevant operations.
</Proof>

### Coherent Sheaves and Proper Morphisms

<Theorem id="proper-pushforward" title="Proper Pushforward Theorem">
Let $f: X \to Y$ be a proper morphism of Noetherian schemes, and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on $X$. Then $f_*\mathcal{F}$ is a coherent sheaf on $Y$.
</Theorem>

<Remark>
This theorem is fundamental: it says that proper morphisms preserve coherence. Without properness, pushforwards of coherent sheaves are typically only quasi-coherent, not coherent.

In classical terms, this says that higher direct images of coherent sheaves under proper morphisms are coherent, which is essential for constructing moduli spaces and studying families of varieties.
</Remark>

<Example id="proper-pushforward-example" title="Pushforward of Structure Sheaf">
Consider $f: X \to \operatorname{Spec} k$ where $X$ is a complete variety over a field $k$. Then $f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is a coherent sheaf on $\operatorname{Spec} k$, which means it's a finite-dimensional $k$-vector space.

In fact, $f_*\mathcal{O}_X = H^0(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$, the space of global sections. For $X$ connected, if $X$ is also reduced, then $H^0(X, \mathcal{O}_X) = k$ (the constant functions).
</Example>

### Proper Base Change

<Theorem id="proper-base-change" title="Proper Base Change Theorem">
Let $f: X \to S$ be a proper morphism and $g: S' \to S$ any morphism. Let $f': X' = X \times_S S' \to S'$ be the base change. Then for any coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$, the natural morphism
$$g^* R^i f_* \mathcal{F} \to R^i f'_* (g')^* \mathcal{F}$$
is an isomorphism for all $i \geq 0$ (where $g': X' \to X$ is the projection).
</Theorem>

<Remark>
This theorem is crucial for studying families of varieties. It says that cohomology "commutes with base change" for proper morphisms, allowing us to compute cohomology of fibers from cohomology of the total space.
</Remark>

## Valuative Criteria

The valuative criteria provide practical methods to check separatedness and properness using discrete valuation rings.

<Definition id="dvr" title="Discrete Valuation Ring">
A **discrete valuation ring (DVR)** is a principal ideal domain with a unique non-zero prime ideal.

Equivalently, it's a local Noetherian domain $R$ of dimension 1 that is integrally closed.

Standard example: $R = k[[t]]$ (formal power series over a field $k$) or $R = \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ (integers localized at a prime $p$).
</Definition>

<Remark>
For a DVR $R$, we have $\operatorname{Spec} R$ consisting of two points: the generic point $\eta$ (corresponding to the zero ideal) and the closed point $s$ (the unique maximal ideal).

The inclusion $\{s\} \hookrightarrow \operatorname{Spec} R$ can be thought of as a "curve" with a special point, providing a geometric probe for testing morphisms.
</Remark>

<Theorem id="valuative-criterion-separated" title="Valuative Criterion for Separatedness">
A morphism $f: X \to S$ of finite type with $S$ Noetherian is separated if and only if the following holds:

For every DVR $R$ with fraction field $K$, every commutative solid arrow diagram
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\operatorname{Spec} K & \to & X \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow f \\
\operatorname{Spec} R & \to & S
\end{array}
$$
admits at most one dotted arrow $\operatorname{Spec} R \to X$ making the diagram commute.
</Theorem>

<Remark>
The valuative criterion says: separated morphisms have unique extensions of morphisms from the generic point to the whole DVR. This is analogous to uniqueness of limits in Hausdorff spaces.
</Remark>

<Example id="valuative-separated-example" title="Separatedness via DVR">
Consider $X = \mathbb{A}^1_k = \operatorname{Spec} k[x]$ over $S = \operatorname{Spec} k$.

Let $R = k[[t]]$ with fraction field $K = k((t))$. Given a morphism $\operatorname{Spec} K \to X$, corresponding to a ring map $k[x] \to k((t))$, say $x \mapsto \sum_{i=n}^{\infty} a_i t^i$ with $a_n \neq 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

If $n \geq 0$, this extends uniquely to $k[x] \to k[[t]]$ (the same formula defines an element of $k[[t]]$).

If $n < 0$, there is no extension to $k[[t]]$ (the image of $x$ would have a pole).

The uniqueness of extension (when it exists) reflects the fact that $\mathbb{A}^1_k$ is separated over $k$.
</Example>

<Theorem id="valuative-criterion-proper" title="Valuative Criterion for Properness">
A morphism $f: X \to S$ of finite type with $S$ Noetherian is proper if and only if the following holds:

For every DVR $R$ with fraction field $K$, every commutative solid arrow diagram
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\operatorname{Spec} K & \to & X \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow f \\
\operatorname{Spec} R & \to & S
\end{array}
$$
admits a unique dotted arrow $\operatorname{Spec} R \to X$ making the diagram commute.
</Theorem>

<Remark>
The valuative criterion for properness requires both existence and uniqueness of the extension. Existence corresponds to universal closedness (compactness), while uniqueness corresponds to separatedness (Hausdorff property).
</Remark>

<Example id="valuative-proper-projective" title="Properness of Projective Line">
Consider $\mathbb{P}^1_k \to \operatorname{Spec} k$. Let $R = k[[t]]$ with $K = k((t))$.

Any morphism $\operatorname{Spec} K \to \mathbb{P}^1_k$ corresponds to a point in $\mathbb{P}^1(K) = K \cup \{\infty\}$.

If the point is $[a_0 : a_1]$ with $a_0, a_1 \in K$, not both zero, we can normalize so that at least one of $a_0, a_1 \in R$ is a unit.

Case 1: $a_0 \in R^*$ (unit). Then $[a_0 : a_1] = [1 : a_1/a_0]$, and $a_1/a_0 \in R$, giving a point in the standard affine chart $\operatorname{Spec} k[x] \subseteq \mathbb{P}^1_k$ with $x = a_1/a_0 \in R$.

Case 2: $a_1 \in R^*$. Then $[a_0 : a_1] = [a_0/a_1 : 1]$, giving a point in the other affine chart with coordinate $a_0/a_1 \in R$.

In all cases, we get a unique extension $\operatorname{Spec} R \to \mathbb{P}^1_k$. This demonstrates properness.
</Example>

<Example id="valuative-affine-space" title="Affine Space is Not Proper (n > 0)">
Consider $\mathbb{A}^1_k \to \operatorname{Spec} k$ with $R = k[[t]]$.

The morphism $\operatorname{Spec} k((t)) \to \mathbb{A}^1_k$ sending $x \mapsto t^{-1}$ does not extend to $\operatorname{Spec} k[[t]] \to \mathbb{A}^1_k$, because $t^{-1} \notin k[[t]]$.

Thus $\mathbb{A}^1_k$ fails the existence part of the valuative criterion for properness (though it satisfies the uniqueness part, being separated).

This corresponds to the fact that $\mathbb{A}^1$ is not compact: sequences can "escape to infinity."
</Example>

<Example id="valuative-curve" title="Valuative Criterion for Curves">
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over a field $k$, and let $U \subseteq C$ be a non-empty open subset (so $C \setminus U$ consists of finitely many closed points).

The morphism $U \to \operatorname{Spec} k$ is separated (being an open immersion into a separated scheme) but not proper.

To see failure of properness via the valuative criterion: let $p \in C \setminus U$ be a closed point. Choose a DVR $R$ with residue field $\kappa(p)$ and a uniformizer $t$ such that $\operatorname{Spec} R$ maps to a neighborhood of $p$ in $C$ with the generic point in $U$ and the closed point at $p$.

Then $\operatorname{Spec} K \to U$ (where $K$ is the fraction field of $R$) cannot extend to $\operatorname{Spec} R \to U$ because $p \notin U$. This violates existence in the valuative criterion.
</Example>

<Example id="valuative-glued-affines" title="Valuative Criterion for Glued Affine Lines">
Consider $X = \mathbb{A}^1_k \setminus \{0\} \sqcup \mathbb{A}^1_k \setminus \{0\}$ (two copies of the punctured line, glued along the identity map).

This is separated over $k$ (the diagonal is closed), but not proper. To see why, consider $R = k[[t]]$ and a morphism $\operatorname{Spec} k((t)) \to X$ sending the generic point to an element $\sum_{i=n}^{\infty} a_i t^i$ with $n < 0$ in one of the copies of $k((t))$.

This morphism doesn't extend to $\operatorname{Spec} k[[t]] \to X$ because:
- It can't extend into the first copy (the image would need to be $t^{-1}$, which doesn't converge),
- It can't extend into the second copy (same reason),
- There's no point in $X$ at "infinity" where it could land.

Thus existence fails in the valuative criterion, confirming $X$ is not proper.
</Example>

## Chow's Lemma and Applications

<Theorem id="chow-lemma" title="Chow's Lemma">
Let $X$ be a proper scheme over a Noetherian base $S$. Then there exists a projective scheme $X'$ over $S$ and a surjective birational morphism $\pi: X' \to X$ such that $\pi$ is an isomorphism over a dense open subset of $X$.

Moreover, if $X$ is reduced, then $\pi$ can be chosen to be a proper birational morphism.
</Theorem>

<Remark>
Chow's Lemma says that proper schemes can be "approximated" by projective schemes. This is extremely useful because projective schemes have more explicit descriptions (embeddings into projective space) and additional tools available.
</Remark>

<Example id="chow-application" title="Application: Proper Schemes Have Projective Covers">
Let $X$ be a complete variety over an algebraically closed field $k$. By Chow's Lemma, there exists a projective variety $\tilde{X}$ and a surjective birational morphism $\pi: \tilde{X} \to X$.

If $X$ is normal, we can take $\pi$ to be the normalization of $X$ in a projective model. This shows that studying complete varieties reduces (to some extent) to studying projective varieties.
</Example>

## Further Remarks

<Remark>
The theory of separated and proper morphisms is foundational for modern algebraic geometry:

1. **Moduli Theory**: Proper morphisms ensure that families of varieties behave well, allowing construction of moduli spaces.

2. **Coherent Cohomology**: The proper pushforward theorem guarantees that cohomology of proper schemes is well-behaved and finite-dimensional.

3. **Intersection Theory**: Properness is essential for defining intersection products and Chern classes.

4. **Arithmetic Geometry**: The valuative criteria translate directly to questions about integral points and rational points on varieties.

5. **Deformation Theory**: Separated morphisms ensure uniqueness of infinitesimal deformations, crucial for studying moduli problems.
</Remark>

<Remark>
In practice, most schemes arising in geometry are separated (affine and projective schemes, quasi-projective varieties, etc.). Non-separated schemes are relatively exotic and typically appear in:
- Moduli problems where objects have non-trivial automorphisms,
- Algebraic stacks and groupoid schemes,
- Pathological counterexamples.

However, understanding non-separated schemes deepens our appreciation of the general theory and highlights why separatedness is a natural condition.

## Exercises

1. Prove that the composition of separated morphisms is separated.

2. Show that if $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to S$ are morphisms with $g \circ f$ separated and $g$ separated, then $f$ is separated.

3. Verify explicitly that the line with doubled origin is not separated by analyzing the diagonal morphism.

4. Prove that any quasi-projective variety over a field $k$ is separated over $k$.

5. Use the valuative criterion to prove that $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ is proper over $k$.

6. Show that the product of proper schemes over $S$ is proper over $S$.

7. Prove that a proper morphism over an algebraically closed field has closed image.

8. Let $X$ be a proper scheme over a field $k$. Show that $H^0(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ is a finite-dimensional $k$-vector space.

9. Construct an example of a separated morphism that is not proper.

10. Prove that properness is local on the base in the fpqc topology.
