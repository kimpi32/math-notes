# Hodge Index Theorem

The Hodge Index Theorem determines the signature of the intersection form on the Neron--Severi group of a smooth projective surface. It is the single most important constraint on the arithmetic of divisors: the intersection pairing is **hyperbolic**, having exactly one positive eigenvalue. This gives rise to the Hodge inequality, Zariski's lemma, the negativity lemma, and an interpretation of $\operatorname{NS}(X) \otimes \mathbb{R}$ as hyperbolic space.

## Statement

<Theorem title="Hodge Index Theorem" number="5.2">
Let $X$ be a smooth projective surface over an algebraically closed field. Let $\operatorname{NS}(X)$ be the Neron--Severi group of $X$ with the intersection pairing, and let $\rho = \operatorname{rk} \operatorname{NS}(X)$ be the Picard number. Then the intersection form on $\operatorname{NS}(X) \otimes \mathbb{R}$ has **signature** $(1, \rho - 1)$.

That is, there exists a basis of $\operatorname{NS}(X) \otimes \mathbb{R}$ in which the intersection matrix is $\operatorname{diag}(1, -1, -1, \ldots, -1)$.
</Theorem>

<Theorem title="Hodge Index Theorem (equivalent formulation)" number="5.3">
Let $X$ be a smooth projective surface and $H$ an ample divisor on $X$. If $D$ is a divisor with $D \cdot H = 0$, then $D^2 \leq 0$, with equality if and only if $D \equiv 0$ (numerically trivial).

In other words, the orthogonal complement $H^{\perp} \subset \operatorname{NS}(X) \otimes \mathbb{R}$ is **negative definite**.
</Theorem>

<Remark title="Why the two formulations are equivalent">
The intersection form has at least one positive direction: if $H$ is ample, then $H^2 > 0$ by the Nakai--Moishezon criterion. Theorem 5.3 says $H^{\perp}$ is negative definite, so there is exactly one positive direction. This means the signature is $(1, \rho - 1)$, recovering Theorem 5.2. Conversely, signature $(1, \rho - 1)$ means the orthogonal complement of any vector with positive self-intersection is negative definite by Sylvester's law of inertia.
</Remark>

## Proof sketch

<Proof title="Proof of the Hodge Index Theorem">
We prove Theorem 5.3. Let $H$ be ample and $D$ a divisor with $D \cdot H = 0$. We must show $D^2 \leq 0$.

**Step 1: Riemann--Roch.** For any integer $n$, Riemann--Roch gives:

$$\chi(\mathcal{O}_X(nD)) = \frac{1}{2}nD \cdot (nD - K_X) + \chi(\mathcal{O}_X) = \frac{n^2}{2}D^2 - \frac{n}{2}D \cdot K_X + \chi(\mathcal{O}_X).$$

**Step 2: Serre duality bound.** We have $h^0(nD) + h^0(K_X - nD) \geq \chi(\mathcal{O}_X(nD))$ since $h^2(nD) = h^0(K_X - nD)$ by Serre duality and $h^1(nD) \geq 0$.

**Step 3: Ampleness constraint.** Since $H$ is ample and $D \cdot H = 0$, we get $(nD) \cdot H = 0$ for all $n$. An effective divisor $E$ satisfies $E \cdot H > 0$ (since $H$ is ample and $E$ is a nontrivial effective cycle), unless $E = 0$. Therefore:

- If $h^0(nD) > 0$ for some $n > 0$, then $nD$ is linearly equivalent to an effective divisor $E$ with $E \cdot H = 0$, forcing $E = 0$, so $nD \sim 0$.
- Similarly, $h^0(K_X - nD) > 0$ forces $K_X - nD$ to be effective with $(K_X - nD) \cdot H = K_X \cdot H > 0$, which is fine -- but for $|n|$ large enough, at most one of $h^0(nD)$ and $h^0(K_X - nD)$ can be nonzero.

**Step 4: Conclusion.** Suppose $D^2 > 0$. Then $\chi(\mathcal{O}_X(nD)) \sim \frac{n^2}{2}D^2 \to +\infty$ as $|n| \to \infty$. So for $|n| \gg 0$, either $h^0(nD)$ or $h^0(K_X - nD)$ grows quadratically. Choose the sign of $n$ so that $h^0(nD) \to \infty$. Then for large $n$, $nD$ is linearly equivalent to an effective divisor, but $nD \cdot H = 0$ forces $nD \sim 0$, contradicting $D^2 > 0$.

Therefore $D^2 \leq 0$. If $D^2 = 0$, a similar but more delicate argument shows $D \equiv 0$.
</Proof>

<Remark title="Characteristic zero vs. positive characteristic">
Over $\mathbb{C}$, the Hodge Index Theorem follows from the Hodge decomposition and the Lefschetz theorem on $(1,1)$-classes. In positive characteristic, the algebraic proof via Riemann--Roch (as above) works uniformly, which is essential since the Hodge decomposition may fail.
</Remark>

## The Hodge inequality

<Theorem title="Hodge inequality (Cauchy--Schwarz for intersection form)" number="5.4">
Let $X$ be a smooth projective surface and let $C, D$ be divisors on $X$ with $C^2 > 0$. Then:

$$(C \cdot D)^2 \geq C^2 \cdot D^2,$$

with equality if and only if $D$ is numerically proportional to $C$, i.e., there exists $\lambda \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $D \equiv \lambda C$.
</Theorem>

<Proof title="Proof of the Hodge inequality">
Since $C^2 > 0$, we can write $D = \frac{C \cdot D}{C^2} C + D'$ where $D' = D - \frac{C \cdot D}{C^2}C$ satisfies $D' \cdot C = 0$. By the Hodge Index Theorem (Theorem 5.3, applied with $C$ playing the role of an ample-like class), $D'^2 \leq 0$. Computing:

$$D^2 = \frac{(C \cdot D)^2}{C^2} + D'^2 \leq \frac{(C \cdot D)^2}{C^2},$$

so $(C \cdot D)^2 \geq C^2 \cdot D^2$. Equality holds iff $D'^2 = 0$, which by Hodge Index means $D' \equiv 0$, i.e., $D \equiv \frac{C \cdot D}{C^2} C$.
</Proof>

<Remark title="Reversed Cauchy--Schwarz">
The Hodge inequality looks like the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality but with the inequality **reversed**: in a positive-definite inner product space, Cauchy--Schwarz gives $(u \cdot v)^2 \leq |u|^2 |v|^2$. The reversal occurs because the intersection form has signature $(1, \rho - 1)$, not $(\rho, 0)$. This is exactly the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality for the Minkowski metric of signature $(1, n-1)$.
</Remark>

## Examples: intersection forms on classical surfaces

<Example id="hodge-P2" title="Intersection form on P^2">
$\operatorname{NS}(\mathbb{P}^2) = \mathbb{Z} \cdot H$ with $H^2 = 1$. The intersection form is the $1 \times 1$ matrix $(1)$, which has signature $(1, 0)$ since $\rho = 1$. The Hodge Index Theorem is vacuous: $H^{\perp} = 0$.

The Hodge inequality gives: for any curve $C$ of degree $d$ and any curve $D$ of degree $e$, $(de)^2 \geq d^2 \cdot e^2$. This is just $d^2 e^2 \geq d^2 e^2$, an equality. Since $\rho = 1$, every divisor is proportional to $H$.
</Example>

<Example id="hodge-P1P1" title="Intersection form on P^1 x P^1">
$\operatorname{NS}(\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1) = \mathbb{Z} F_1 \oplus \mathbb{Z} F_2$ with $F_1^2 = F_2^2 = 0$ and $F_1 \cdot F_2 = 1$. The intersection matrix in the basis $\{F_1, F_2\}$ has entries $Q_{11} = Q_{22} = 0$ and $Q_{12} = Q_{21} = 1$.

The eigenvalues are $+1$ and $-1$ (eigenvectors $F_1 + F_2$ and $F_1 - F_2$), confirming signature $(1, 1)$.

**Hodge inequality check**: Take $C = F_1 + F_2$ (the diagonal, with $C^2 = 2 > 0$) and $D = aF_1 + bF_2$. Then $(C \cdot D)^2 = (a + b)^2$ and $C^2 \cdot D^2 = 2 \cdot 2ab = 4ab$. The inequality $(a+b)^2 \geq 4ab$ is equivalent to $(a - b)^2 \geq 0$ ✓.
</Example>

<Example id="hodge-blowup" title="Intersection form on Bl_p(P^2)">
$\operatorname{NS}(\operatorname{Bl}_P(\mathbb{P}^2)) = \mathbb{Z} H \oplus \mathbb{Z} E$ with $H^2 = 1$, $E^2 = -1$, $H \cdot E = 0$. The intersection matrix is $\operatorname{diag}(1, -1)$, which has signature $(1, 1)$ directly.

Let $D = aH - bE$. Then $D \cdot H = a$ and $D^2 = a^2 - b^2$. If $D \cdot H = 0$, then $a = 0$ and $D^2 = -b^2 \leq 0$, with equality iff $b = 0$ ✓.
</Example>

<Example id="hodge-blowup-n" title="Intersection form on Bl_{p_1,...,p_n}(P^2)">
Blowing up $\mathbb{P}^2$ at $n$ points in general position gives $\operatorname{NS}(X) = \mathbb{Z} H \oplus \mathbb{Z} E_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{Z} E_n$ with $H^2 = 1$, $E_i^2 = -1$, $H \cdot E_i = 0$, $E_i \cdot E_j = 0$ for $i \neq j$. The intersection matrix is $\operatorname{diag}(1, -1, -1, \ldots, -1)$, directly exhibiting signature $(1, n)$.

For $n = 6$: the del Pezzo surface of degree $3$ (a cubic surface in $\mathbb{P}^3$) has $\rho = 7$, intersection form $\operatorname{diag}(1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1)$, and contains the famous $27$ lines.

For $n = 8$: the del Pezzo surface of degree $1$ has $\rho = 9$, and the anti-canonical class $-K = 3H - E_1 - \cdots - E_8$ satisfies $(-K)^2 = 9 - 8 = 1$.
</Example>

<Example id="hodge-K3" title="Intersection form on K3 surfaces">
A K3 surface over $\mathbb{C}$ has $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \Lambda_{K3}$, the K3 lattice, which is isometric to $U^3 \oplus E_8(-1)^2$, a unimodular lattice of rank $22$ and signature $(3, 19)$.

The Neron--Severi group $\operatorname{NS}(X) = H^{1,1}(X) \cap H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$ has rank $\rho$ with $1 \leq \rho \leq 20$. By the Hodge Index Theorem, the intersection form on $\operatorname{NS}(X)$ has signature $(1, \rho - 1)$.

- **Generic K3** ($\rho = 1$): $\operatorname{NS}(X) = \mathbb{Z} H$ with $H^2 = 2d$ for some $d \geq 1$.
- **$\rho = 2$ example**: The Kummer surface of a generic abelian surface has $\rho = 17$ (not $2$!). A K3 with $\rho = 2$ could have NS lattice with Gram matrix having entries $2d, a$ on the first row and $a, -2e$ on the second, for appropriate $d, e, a$.
- **$\rho = 20$ (singular K3)**: The Fermat quartic $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + w^4 = 0$ over $\overline{\mathbb{F}_3}$ achieves $\rho = 22$ (the Tate conjecture), but over $\mathbb{C}$ the maximum is $\rho = 20$.
</Example>

<Example id="hodge-hirzebruch" title="Intersection form on Hirzebruch surfaces">
The Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_n$ has $\operatorname{NS}(\mathbb{F}_n) = \mathbb{Z} C_0 \oplus \mathbb{Z} F$ with $C_0^2 = -n$, $F^2 = 0$, $C_0 \cdot F = 1$.

The intersection matrix has $Q_{11} = -n$, $Q_{12} = Q_{21} = 1$, $Q_{22} = 0$, with $\det(Q) = -1$ and eigenvalues $\frac{-n \pm \sqrt{n^2 + 4}}{2}$. One eigenvalue is positive, one is negative, confirming signature $(1, 1)$.

In the basis $H = C_0 + nF$ (which is nef with $H^2 = n$) and $F$: the matrix entries become $n, 1, 1, 0$ respectively, still with one positive and one negative eigenvalue.

**Hodge inequality check**: $C_0^2 = -n < 0$, so we cannot apply the Hodge inequality with $C = C_0$. Taking $C = C_0 + nF$ (with $C^2 = n > 0$ for $n \geq 1$) and $D = F$: $(C \cdot D)^2 = 1$ and $C^2 \cdot D^2 = n \cdot 0 = 0$, so $1 \geq 0$ ✓.
</Example>

## Zariski's lemma

<Theorem title="Zariski's lemma" number="5.5">
Let $f: X \to B$ be a fibration from a smooth projective surface to a smooth curve, and let $F = \sum_i a_i C_i$ be a fiber of $f$ (so $F$ is connected). For any divisor $D = \sum_i d_i C_i$ supported on the fiber:

- $D^2 \leq 0$.
- $D^2 = 0$ if and only if $D$ is a rational multiple of $F$.

Equivalently, the intersection matrix $(C_i \cdot C_j)$ restricted to the irreducible components of a fiber is **negative semi-definite**, with kernel spanned by $F$.
</Theorem>

<Proof title="Proof via the Hodge Index Theorem">
Let $H$ be an ample divisor on $X$. Since $F$ is a fiber of $f$, all fibers are numerically equivalent, so $F \equiv F'$ for any other fiber $F'$. Hence $F^2 = F \cdot F' = 0$ (distinct fibers are disjoint).

For $D$ supported on $F$, write $D = \lambda F + D'$ where $\lambda = \frac{D \cdot H}{F \cdot H}$ (this makes $D' \cdot H = 0$). By the Hodge Index Theorem, $D'^2 \leq 0$ with equality iff $D' \equiv 0$, i.e., $D \equiv \lambda F$.

Since $D^2 = \lambda^2 F^2 + 2\lambda F \cdot D' + D'^2 = 0 + 0 + D'^2$ (because $F \cdot D' = 0$, as $D'$ is supported on $F$ and $F \cdot C_i = 0$ for components $C_i$ of $F$), we get $D^2 = D'^2 \leq 0$.
</Proof>

<Example id="zariski-elliptic" title="Zariski's lemma for elliptic fibrations">
Let $f: X \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be an elliptic fibration with a singular fiber of Kodaira type $I_n$ (a cycle of $n$ rational curves $C_1, \ldots, C_n$, each with $C_i^2 = -2$, meeting in a cycle: $C_i \cdot C_{i+1} = 1$ for indices mod $n$).

The fiber is $F = C_1 + C_2 + \cdots + C_n$ with $F^2 = \sum_i C_i^2 + 2\sum_{i} C_i \cdot C_{i+1} = -2n + 2n = 0$ ✓.

The intersection matrix of the $C_i$ is the negative of the Cartan matrix of type $\tilde{A}_{n-1}$, which is negative semi-definite with $1$-dimensional kernel spanned by $(1, 1, \ldots, 1)$, confirming Zariski's lemma.

For a type $I_1$ fiber (a nodal rational curve $C$ with $C^2 = -1$... actually, $C^2 = 0$ since it is the entire fiber): a single irreducible fiber has $F = C$ with $C^2 = 0$.
</Example>

<Example id="zariski-type-In" title="Checking Zariski on type IV* fiber">
Consider a Kodaira type $IV^*$ fiber ($\tilde{E}_6$): the fiber $F = C_0 + 2C_1 + 3C_2 + 2C_3 + C_4 + 2C_5 + C_6$ where all $C_i^2 = -2$. The intersection matrix of $C_0, \ldots, C_6$ is the negative of the extended Cartan matrix of $E_6$, which is negative semi-definite with kernel spanned by the coefficients $(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1)$. One verifies $F^2 = 0$, and any proper sub-combination $D = \sum d_i C_i$ not proportional to $F$ satisfies $D^2 < 0$.
</Example>

## Negativity lemma

<Theorem title="Negativity lemma" number="5.6">
Let $f: Y \to X$ be a birational morphism of smooth projective surfaces, and let $E = \sum_i a_i E_i$ be an effective divisor supported on the exceptional locus of $f$ (i.e., each $E_i$ is an exceptional curve contracted by $f$). If $E$ is $f$-numerically trivial (meaning $E \cdot C = 0$ for every curve $C$ contracted by $f$), then $E = 0$.

More generally, if $E \cdot E_i \leq 0$ for all $i$, then $E$ is effective (all $a_i \geq 0$) or $E = 0$. And if $E$ is effective and nonzero, then $E^2 < 0$.
</Theorem>

<Remark title="Why this follows from Hodge Index">
The exceptional curves $E_1, \ldots, E_n$ of a birational morphism $f: Y \to X$ are contracted to points, so they behave like components of fibers. The intersection matrix $(E_i \cdot E_j)$ is **negative definite** (not just semi-definite, since the exceptional locus is not a complete fiber). This is a consequence of the Hodge Index Theorem: the $E_i$ all satisfy $E_i \cdot H = 0$ for $H = f^*A$ with $A$ ample on $X$, and they are independent in $\operatorname{NS}(Y)$, so the restriction of the intersection form to $\operatorname{span}(E_i)$ lies in $H^{\perp}$, which is negative definite.
</Remark>

<Example id="negativity-blowup" title="Negativity for a single blowup">
Let $f: \operatorname{Bl}_P(X) \to X$ with exceptional divisor $E$. Then $E^2 = -1 < 0$. Any effective divisor $D = aE$ ($a > 0$) supported on the exceptional locus has $D^2 = -a^2 < 0$ ✓.

After blowing up two points, the exceptional locus is $E_1 \cup E_2$ with $E_1^2 = E_2^2 = -1$ and $E_1 \cdot E_2 = 0$. The intersection matrix $\operatorname{diag}(-1, -1)$ is negative definite ✓.
</Example>

<Example id="negativity-resolution" title="Negativity for resolution of an A_n singularity">
Resolving an $A_n$ surface singularity (locally $xy = z^{n+1}$) produces a chain of $n$ exceptional curves $E_1, \ldots, E_n$ with $E_i^2 = -2$ and $E_i \cdot E_{i+1} = 1$. The intersection matrix is the negative of the Cartan matrix of $A_n$, which has eigenvalues $-2 + 2\cos(\pi k/(n+1))$ for $k = 1, \ldots, n$. All eigenvalues are negative, confirming negative definiteness.

For $n = 1$: a single $(-2)$-curve. For $n = 2$: the matrix has diagonal entries $-2, -2$ and off-diagonal entries $1, 1$, with eigenvalues $-1$ and $-3$.
</Example>

## Light cone and hyperbolic geometry

<Definition title="Light cone and positive cone" number="5.4">
In $V = \operatorname{NS}(X) \otimes \mathbb{R}$, the **light cone** is:

$$\mathcal{L} = \{ D \in V : D^2 = 0 \}.$$

The **positive cone** is one of the two connected components of $\{ D \in V : D^2 > 0 \}$; we choose the component $\mathcal{C}^+$ containing an ample class. The **ample cone** $\operatorname{Amp}(X) \subset \mathcal{C}^+$ and the **nef cone** $\overline{\operatorname{Amp}(X)} = \operatorname{Nef}(X) \subset \overline{\mathcal{C}^+}$ sit inside the positive cone.
</Definition>

<Remark title="Hyperbolic geometry of NS(X) tensor R">
Since the intersection form on $V = \operatorname{NS}(X) \otimes \mathbb{R}$ has signature $(1, \rho - 1)$, the projectivization of the positive cone:

$$\mathbb{H}^{\rho - 1} = \{ [D] \in \mathbb{P}(V) : D^2 > 0 \} / \mathbb{R}_{>0}$$

is a model of **hyperbolic $(\rho - 1)$-space**. The intersection form induces the hyperbolic metric:

$$\cosh d([C], [D]) = \frac{|C \cdot D|}{\sqrt{C^2} \cdot \sqrt{D^2}}$$

for classes $C, D$ in the positive cone.

The Hodge inequality $(C \cdot D)^2 \geq C^2 \cdot D^2$ ensures $\cosh d \geq 1$, which is exactly the condition for the hyperbolic distance to be well-defined. Equality (i.e., $d = 0$) occurs iff $C$ and $D$ are proportional.
</Remark>

<Example id="hyperbolic-P1P1" title="Hyperbolic line for P^1 x P^1">
For $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$, $V = \mathbb{R}^2$ with the form $Q(a,b) = 2ab$. The positive cone is $\{(a,b) : ab > 0\}$, which has two components; the one containing $(1,1)$ is $\{a > 0, b > 0\}$. The projectivization $\mathbb{H}^1$ is parametrized by $t = a/b \in (0, \infty)$, a copy of the real line (the hyperbolic line).

The ample cone is $\{a > 0, b > 0\}$ (divisors of bidegree $(a,b)$ with $a, b > 0$), and the nef cone boundary consists of the rays $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} F_1$ and $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} F_2$ (the two rulings), which lie on the light cone.
</Example>

<Example id="hyperbolic-K3" title="Hyperbolic space for K3 surfaces">
For a K3 surface with $\rho = 2$ and NS lattice generated by $H, C$ with $H^2 = 4$, $C^2 = -2$, $H \cdot C = 1$: the positive cone in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is given by $(aH + bC)^2 = 4a^2 - 2b^2 + 2ab > 0$.

The ample cone is cut out by requiring additionally $D \cdot C > 0$ (i.e., $-2b + a > 0$) for the $(-2)$-curve $C$. So the ample cone is $\{4a^2 - 2b^2 + 2ab > 0\} \cap \{a - 2b > 0\}$.

In hyperbolic $1$-space $\mathbb{H}^1$, the ample cone corresponds to a half-line, bounded by the "wall" defined by the $(-2)$-curve $C$. Reflection across this wall is the Picard--Lefschetz reflection $s_C: D \mapsto D + (D \cdot C) C$.
</Example>

## Application to arithmetic: Faltings height pairing

<Theorem title="Arithmetic Hodge Index (Faltings--Hriljac)" number="5.7">
Let $X$ be an arithmetic surface (a regular model of a curve $C$ over a number field $K$, fibered over $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_K)$). The Arakelov intersection pairing on the group of arithmetic divisors $\widehat{\operatorname{Div}}(X)$ has the Hodge index property:

If $\widehat{D}$ is an arithmetic divisor with $\widehat{D} \cdot \widehat{\omega} = 0$ (where $\widehat{\omega}$ is the arithmetic canonical class), then $\widehat{D}^2 \leq 0$, with equality iff $\widehat{D}$ is numerically trivial.

Equivalently, the Neron--Tate height pairing on the Jacobian $J(C)(\overline{K})$ is **negative definite** modulo torsion.
</Theorem>

<Example id="faltings-elliptic" title="Arithmetic Hodge index for elliptic curves">
For an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$, the Neron--Tate height $\hat{h}: E(\mathbb{Q}) \otimes \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a positive-definite quadratic form (after accounting for torsion). The rank of $E(\mathbb{Q})$ is the dimension of this space.

The arithmetic Hodge Index Theorem ensures that the height pairing matrix on a basis $P_1, \ldots, P_r$ of $E(\mathbb{Q})/\text{torsion}$ has $\det(\langle P_i, P_j \rangle) > 0$, which is the **regulator** of $E$. This appears in the BSD conjecture:

$$L^{(r)}(E, 1) / r! = \Omega_E \cdot \operatorname{Reg}(E) \cdot \prod c_p \cdot |\text{III}| / |E(\mathbb{Q})_{\text{tors}}|^2.$$
</Example>

## Algebraic vs. topological intersection form

<Remark title="Topological intersection form over C">
Over $\mathbb{C}$, a smooth projective surface $X$ has a topological intersection form on $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$, a unimodular symmetric bilinear form of rank $b_2 = \dim H^2(X, \mathbb{R})$. By the Hodge decomposition:

$$H^2(X, \mathbb{C}) = H^{2,0} \oplus H^{1,1} \oplus H^{0,2},$$

where $\dim H^{2,0} = p_g$, $\dim H^{1,1} = b_2 - 2p_g$, $\dim H^{0,2} = p_g$.

The full intersection form on $H^2(X, \mathbb{R})$ has signature $(2p_g + 1, b_2 - 2p_g - 1)$ by the Hodge--Riemann bilinear relations. The algebraic part $\operatorname{NS}(X) \otimes \mathbb{R} \subset H^{1,1}_{\mathbb{R}}$ has signature $(1, \rho - 1)$ by the Hodge Index Theorem.

The transcendental lattice $T(X) = \operatorname{NS}(X)^{\perp} \cap H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$ carries the remaining signature $(2p_g, b_2 - 2p_g - \rho)$.
</Remark>

<Example id="topological-K3" title="Topological vs. algebraic for K3 surfaces">
A K3 surface has $b_2 = 22$, $p_g = 1$, so the topological intersection form has signature $(3, 19)$ on $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}) \cong U^3 \oplus E_8(-1)^2$.

The algebraic part $\operatorname{NS}(X)$ has signature $(1, \rho - 1)$, and the transcendental lattice $T(X)$ has signature $(2, 20 - \rho)$.

- For $\rho = 1$: $\operatorname{NS}(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ (signature $(1, 0)$) and $T(X)$ has signature $(2, 19)$.
- For $\rho = 20$: $\operatorname{NS}(X)$ has signature $(1, 19)$ and $T(X)$ has signature $(2, 0)$, meaning $T(X)$ is a positive-definite lattice of rank $2$.
</Example>

<Example id="topological-general-type" title="Surfaces of general type and geography">
For a minimal surface of general type, Noether's formula gives $\chi(\mathcal{O}_X) = \frac{1}{12}(K^2 + e(X))$ where $e(X) = 2 - 4q + b_2$ is the topological Euler characteristic. The Bogomolov--Miyaoka--Yau inequality gives $K^2 \leq 3 e(X)$ (equivalently $K^2 \leq 9 \chi(\mathcal{O}_X)$).

The topological intersection form on $H^2$ has signature $(2p_g + 1, b_2 - 2p_g - 1)$. By Freedman's theorem, the homeomorphism type of the underlying $4$-manifold is determined by this form (plus $b_1$). But the smooth structure carries more information (Donaldson theory), and the algebraic structure even more.
</Example>

## Further examples and applications

<Example id="hodge-enriques" title="Intersection form on Enriques surfaces">
An Enriques surface $Y$ has $K_Y \not\equiv 0$ but $2K_Y \sim 0$. Its Neron--Severi group has rank $\rho = 10$, and the intersection form is the even unimodular lattice $U \oplus E_8(-1)$ of signature $(1, 9)$.

The Hodge Index Theorem gives: for $H$ ample on $Y$ and $D \cdot H = 0$, we have $D^2 \leq 0$. The lattice $U \oplus E_8(-1)$ is the unique even unimodular lattice of this signature, mirroring the uniqueness of the $E_8$ lattice.

Any $(-2)$-curve $C$ on $Y$ satisfies $C^2 = -2$ and defines a reflection $s_C: D \mapsto D + (D \cdot C)C$ preserving the lattice. The Weyl group generated by these reflections acts on the ample cone.

<Example id="hodge-abelian" title="Intersection form on abelian surfaces">
An abelian surface $A$ has $\rho(A)$ ranging from $1$ to $4$ (over $\mathbb{C}$). The Neron--Severi group embeds into $\operatorname{End}(A)^{\text{sym}}$ via the Appell--Humbert theorem. The intersection form on $\operatorname{NS}(A)$ has signature $(1, \rho - 1)$.

- **$\rho = 1$**: $\operatorname{NS}(A) = \mathbb{Z} L$ with $L^2 = 2d$ (a polarization of type $(1, d)$). Signature $(1, 0)$.
- **$\rho = 2$** (generic principally polarized): $\operatorname{NS}(A) \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$ with signature $(1, 1)$.
- **$\rho = 3$** ($A$ has real multiplication): the extra endomorphisms produce additional algebraic classes.
- **$\rho = 4$** ($A \cong E_1 \times E_2$ with CM): $\operatorname{NS}(A)$ is rank $4$ with signature $(1, 3)$.

<Example id="hodge-inequality-application" title="Hodge inequality bounds degrees of curves">
Let $X = \mathbb{P}^2$ blown up at one point, with $\operatorname{NS}(X) = \mathbb{Z} H \oplus \mathbb{Z} E$. Let $C$ be an irreducible curve of class $aH - bE$ (degree $a$, multiplicity $b$ at the blown-up point). By irreducibility, $C$ is effective and:

- $C \cdot H = a > 0$ and $C \cdot E = b \geq 0$.
- $C^2 = a^2 - b^2 \geq -1$ (genus formula: $g = \frac{(a-1)(a-2)}{2} - \frac{b(b-1)}{2} \geq 0$).

The Hodge inequality with $H$ (taking $H^2 = 1 > 0$, $D = C$): $(H \cdot C)^2 \geq H^2 \cdot C^2$, i.e., $a^2 \geq a^2 - b^2$, giving $b^2 \geq 0$, which is trivial. But applying with the ample class $A = 3H - E$ ($A^2 = 8$) and $C = aH - bE$: $(3a - b)^2 \cdot 1 \geq (a^2 - b^2) \cdot 1$... this requires more care.

A more useful application: if $C, D$ are two distinct irreducible curves both passing through the blown-up point with multiplicities $b, d$, then by the Hodge inequality on the original $\mathbb{P}^2$: their intersection number satisfies $C \cdot D = ae - bd \cdot ... $. The cleanest use is: $(C \cdot D)^2 \geq C^2 \cdot D^2$ when $C^2 > 0$.

<Example id="hodge-fibration" title="Hodge Index constrains fibration structure">
Suppose a smooth projective surface $X$ has two divisors $F_1, F_2$ with $F_1^2 = F_2^2 = 0$ and $F_1 \cdot F_2 > 0$. Then $F_1$ and $F_2$ are independent in $\operatorname{NS}(X)$ and span a sublattice of signature $(1, 1)$ (the form $2(F_1 \cdot F_2) ab$ in coordinates $aF_1 + bF_2$ gives eigenvalues $\pm F_1 \cdot F_2$).

By the Hodge Index Theorem, $\rho \geq 2$. Moreover, if $F_1$ is the class of a fiber of a fibration $f_1: X \to B_1$, then $F_1^2 = 0$ is automatic. Two independent fibrations $f_1, f_2$ force $\rho \geq 2$ and the sublattice $\mathbb{Z} F_1 \oplus \mathbb{Z} F_2$ has signature $(1, 1)$.

This is realized by $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$: the two projections give fiber classes $F_1, F_2$ with $F_1 \cdot F_2 = 1$.

## Consequences for the cone structure

<Remark title="The positive cone is round">
The Hodge Index Theorem implies that the positive cone $\mathcal{C}^+ = \{D \in \operatorname{NS}(X) \otimes \mathbb{R} : D^2 > 0, D \cdot H > 0\}$ (for a fixed ample $H$) is a convex open cone. This convexity is a consequence of the Minkowski geometry: in signature $(1, n)$, the set of future-pointing timelike vectors is convex.

In particular: if $C$ and $D$ are both in $\mathcal{C}^+$, then $C + D \in \mathcal{C}^+$, i.e., $(C + D)^2 > 0$. This follows from $(C + D)^2 = C^2 + 2C \cdot D + D^2 > 0$, since $C \cdot D > 0$ by the Hodge inequality (both $C^2 > 0$ and $D^2 > 0$ with $C, D$ in the same component, so $C \cdot D \geq \sqrt{C^2 \cdot D^2} > 0$).

<Example id="cone-blowup-6" title="Cone structure on cubic surface">
The cubic surface $X = \operatorname{Bl}_{p_1, \ldots, p_6}(\mathbb{P}^2)$ has $\rho = 7$ and NS lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{1,6}$ (one positive, six negative directions). The $27$ lines on the cubic surface are the $(-1)$-curves, and the effective cone is generated by these $27$ classes.

The ample cone is the interior of the dual of the effective cone of curves, cut out by the $27$ inequalities $D \cdot L_i > 0$ for each line $L_i$. In the hyperbolic $6$-space $\mathbb{H}^6$, this is a polytope bounded by $27$ hyperplanes.

The Weyl group $W(E_6)$ of order $51840$ acts on the NS lattice, permuting the $27$ lines and preserving the intersection form.

## Summary

<Remark title="Central role of the Hodge Index Theorem">
The Hodge Index Theorem is the foundation for the arithmetic of divisors on surfaces:

- **Signature** $(1, \rho - 1)$: the intersection form is hyperbolic, having exactly one positive direction.
- **Hodge inequality**: $(C \cdot D)^2 \geq C^2 \cdot D^2$ when $C^2 > 0$, the reversed Cauchy--Schwarz for the Minkowski metric.
- **Zariski's lemma**: fibers of fibrations have negative semi-definite intersection matrix.
- **Negativity lemma**: exceptional divisors of birational morphisms have negative definite intersection matrix.
- **Hyperbolic geometry**: $\operatorname{NS}(X) \otimes \mathbb{R}$ is a model of hyperbolic space, and ample/nef cones are convex subsets in this geometry.
- **Arithmetic analogue**: the Faltings--Hriljac theorem extends the Hodge index property to Arakelov intersection theory, with the Neron--Tate height as the arithmetic intersection pairing.

Every computation of linear systems, every ampleness criterion, and every birational geometry argument on surfaces ultimately relies on the definiteness properties guaranteed by this theorem.
