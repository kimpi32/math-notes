# Etale Descent

Etale descent specializes the general machinery of faithfully flat descent to the etale topology. Because etale morphisms are the algebraic analogue of local homeomorphisms, etale descent gives particularly clean results: it is effective for separated schemes, it connects naturally to Galois theory, and it provides the framework for defining algebraic spaces and Deligne-Mumford stacks.

## Statement of the Theorem

<Theorem title="Etale Descent for Quasi-coherent Sheaves" number="1.5">
Let $f: Y \to X$ be a surjective etale morphism of schemes. Then the pullback functor

$$f^*: \operatorname{QCoh}(X) \to \operatorname{DD}(Y/X, \operatorname{QCoh})$$

is an equivalence of categories.

In other words, quasi-coherent sheaves on $X$ are equivalent to quasi-coherent sheaves on $Y$ equipped with descent data satisfying the cocycle condition.
</Theorem>

<Remark title="Etale descent as a special case of fpqc descent">
Since etale surjective morphisms are fpqc (they are flat, locally of finite presentation, and surjective), etale descent for quasi-coherent sheaves is a special case of faithfully flat descent. The added value of the etale setting is:

1. Fiber products $Y \times_X Y$ and $Y \times_X Y \times_X Y$ are much better behaved (etale morphisms are unramified, so the diagonal is an open immersion).
2. Descent is effective for a wider class of geometric objects (separated schemes, algebraic spaces).
3. The connection to Galois theory is immediate and explicit.
</Remark>

<Theorem title="Etale Descent for Separated Schemes" number="1.6">
Let $f: Y \to X$ be a surjective etale morphism. Let $Z$ be a separated $Y$-scheme with descent data $\varphi: p_1^*Z \xrightarrow{\sim} p_2^*Z$ satisfying the cocycle condition. Then descent is effective: there exists a separated $X$-scheme $W$ with $W \times_X Y \cong Z$ compatibly with $\varphi$, and $W$ is unique up to unique isomorphism.

More generally, descent is effective for **algebraic spaces** separated over $X$ along etale surjective morphisms.
</Theorem>

## Galois Descent

<Definition title="Galois descent" number="1.7">
Let $L/K$ be a finite Galois extension with Galois group $G$. The morphism $f: \operatorname{Spec}(L) \to \operatorname{Spec}(K)$ is finite etale with

$$\operatorname{Spec}(L) \times_{\operatorname{Spec}(K)} \operatorname{Spec}(L) \cong \coprod_{g \in G} \operatorname{Spec}(L).$$

**Galois descent** is etale descent for this specific cover. A descent datum for an $L$-object $V$ amounts to a collection of isomorphisms $\{\varphi_g: V \xrightarrow{\sim} g^*V\}_{g \in G}$ satisfying $\varphi_{gh} = h^*(\varphi_g) \circ \varphi_h$ (the cocycle condition reduces to a group action condition).
</Definition>

<Example id="galois-descent-vector-spaces" title="Galois descent for vector spaces">
**Statement**: The category of $K$-vector spaces is equivalent to the category of $L$-vector spaces with semilinear $G$-action.

Given a $K$-vector space $W$, the $L$-vector space $V = W \otimes_K L$ has a natural semilinear $G$-action: $g(w \otimes \lambda) = w \otimes g(\lambda)$.

Conversely, given $(V, \{g\}_{g \in G})$, we recover $W = V^G = \{v \in V \mid g(v) = v \; \forall g \in G\}$.

**Concrete example**: $L = \mathbb{Q}(i)$, $K = \mathbb{Q}$, $G = \{1, \sigma\}$ where $\sigma(i) = -i$. The $\mathbb{Q}(i)$-vector space $V = \mathbb{Q}(i)^2$ with semilinear $\sigma$-action $\sigma(z_1, z_2) = (\bar{z}_1, \bar{z}_2)$ descends to $W = \mathbb{Q}^2$.

But a different $\sigma$-action, say $\sigma(z_1, z_2) = (\bar{z}_2, \bar{z}_1)$, also descends to a $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space of dimension 2. This gives an isomorphic $W$, reflecting that $H^1(G, GL_2(L)) = 1$ (non-abelian Hilbert 90).
</Example>

<Example id="galois-descent-curves" title="Galois descent for curves">
Let $L/K$ be Galois with group $G$. A smooth projective curve $C$ over $K$ can be studied via its base change $C_L = C \times_K L$. Conversely, a curve $D$ over $L$ with a $G$-equivariant structure (compatible semilinear $G$-action on $D$) descends to a curve over $K$ if the action is "geometric" (respects the scheme structure).

**Example**: The curve $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ over $\mathbb{R}$ has a natural $\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R})$-equivariant structure on its complexification. Complex conjugation acts on $\mathbb{C}$-points by $(x, y) \mapsto (\bar{x}, \bar{y})$, and the fixed points are exactly the $\mathbb{R}$-points.

**Example**: The conic $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0$ in $\mathbb{P}^2_\mathbb{R}$ has no $\mathbb{R}$-points (it is a non-trivial Brauer-Severi curve). Over $\mathbb{C}$, it becomes isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C}$, but the descent datum is non-trivial: it corresponds to the unique non-trivial element of $\operatorname{Br}(\mathbb{R})[2] = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.
</Example>

<Example id="galois-descent-quadratic-forms" title="Descent for quadratic forms">
Quadratic forms over $K$ can be studied via Galois descent. A quadratic form $q$ over $K$ extends to $q_L$ over $L$, which is easier to classify (e.g., over algebraically closed fields, every non-degenerate form is equivalent to $\sum x_i^2$).

The set of $K$-forms of the standard quadratic form $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$ is $H^1(G_K, O_n)$ where $O_n$ is the orthogonal group. The exact sequence $1 \to SO_n \to O_n \to \mu_2 \to 1$ gives a long exact sequence relating quadratic forms to the discriminant and the spinor norm.

For $n = 2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$: quadratic forms $ax^2 + by^2$ with $ab \neq 0$ are classified (up to scaling) by $a \in \mathbb{Q}^\times/(\mathbb{Q}^\times)^2$. The form $x^2 + y^2$ is isomorphic to $x^2 - y^2$ over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})$ but not over $\mathbb{Q}$.
</Example>

## Applications to Algebraic Spaces

<Definition title="Algebraic space" number="1.8">
An **algebraic space** over a scheme $S$ is an fppf sheaf $X: (\mathbf{Sch}/S)^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathbf{Set}$ such that:

1. The diagonal $\Delta: X \to X \times_S X$ is representable by schemes.
2. There exists a surjective etale morphism $U \to X$ from a scheme $U$ (an **etale atlas**).

Algebraic spaces arise naturally when descent for separated schemes along etale covers is not enough (e.g., when descending non-separated objects). They are defined so that etale descent is tautologically effective.
</Definition>

<Example id="algebraic-space-quotient" title="Quotients as algebraic spaces">
Let $X$ be a scheme with an action of a finite group $G$. The quotient $X/G$ always exists as an algebraic space (though not always as a scheme). If $G$ acts freely and $X$ is separated, then $X/G$ is a separated algebraic space.

**Concrete example**: Let $X = \mathbb{A}^2_k \setminus \{0\}$ and $G = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ acting by $(x,y) \mapsto (-x, -y)$. The quotient $X/G$ is a smooth algebraic space, but it is NOT a scheme (it is the "affine plane with doubled origin" quotient). The etale cover $X \to X/G$ exhibits $X/G$ as an algebraic space via etale descent.

More generally, if a finite group $G$ acts on a scheme $X$ and the stabilizers are trivial (free action), then $X \to X/G$ is a finite etale $G$-torsor, and $X/G$ is the algebraic space obtained by etale descent.
</Example>

<Example id="algebraic-space-non-scheme" title="An algebraic space that is not a scheme">
The classical example (due to Hironaka) of an algebraic space that is not a scheme: start with a smooth threefold $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ with an involution $\sigma$ that acts freely outside a codimension-2 subvariety. The quotient $X/\sigma$ exists as an algebraic space but cannot be a scheme (it fails to have enough open affine subsets).

Another example: the etale quotient of $\mathbb{A}^1$ by the equivalence relation that identifies $0$ and $1$ (but this one fails to be separated, so it requires more care).
</Example>

## Etale Descent for Properties

<Example id="descent-properties-etale" title="Properties that descend along etale covers">
The following properties descend along etale surjective morphisms $f: Y \to X$:

**Properties of schemes**: reduced, normal, regular, Cohen-Macaulay, locally Noetherian, S$_n$ (Serre's condition), R$_n$ (regularity in codimension $n$).

**Properties of morphisms**: if $g: Z \to X$ is a morphism and $g': Z \times_X Y \to Y$ is its base change, then $g$ is flat (resp. smooth, etale, unramified, proper, finite, affine, quasi-finite, a closed immersion, an open immersion) if and only if $g'$ is.

**Properties of sheaves**: a coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $X$ is locally free of rank $r$ if and only if $f^*\mathcal{F}$ is locally free of rank $r$ on $Y$.

These results follow from etale descent being a special case of fpqc descent, combined with the fact that etale morphisms are open maps.
</Example>

<Example id="descent-smoothness-check" title="Checking smoothness by etale descent">
To verify that a morphism $g: Z \to X$ is smooth, it suffices to check after an etale base change. For instance, consider $Z = \operatorname{Spec}(k[x,y]/(y^2 - x^3 - x)) \to X = \operatorname{Spec}(k)$ (an elliptic curve over $k$ with $\operatorname{char}(k) \neq 2, 3$).

After the etale cover $\operatorname{Spec}(\bar{k}) \to \operatorname{Spec}(k)$, the morphism becomes $E_{\bar{k}} \to \operatorname{Spec}(\bar{k})$, which is smooth (the curve $y^2 = x^3 + x$ is non-singular since $4 \cdot 1^3 + 27 \cdot 0 = 4 \neq 0$). By etale descent of smoothness, the original morphism is smooth.
</Example>

## Etale Descent and Cohomology

<Example id="etale-descent-cohomology" title="Descent spectral sequence">
For a surjective etale morphism $f: Y \to X$ and an abelian sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $X_{\text{et}}$, there is a **descent spectral sequence** (or Cech-to-derived spectral sequence):

$$E_2^{p,q} = \check{H}^p(\{Y \to X\}, \mathcal{H}^q(\mathcal{F})) \implies H^{p+q}_{\text{et}}(X, \mathcal{F})$$

where $\mathcal{H}^q(\mathcal{F})$ is the presheaf $U \mapsto H^q_{\text{et}}(U, \mathcal{F})$ and the Cech cohomology is computed using the simplicial scheme $Y^{\times_X \bullet}$.

When $f$ is a Galois cover with group $G$ (e.g., $\operatorname{Spec}(L) \to \operatorname{Spec}(K)$ for a Galois extension $L/K$), the spectral sequence becomes the **Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence**:

$$E_2^{p,q} = H^p(G, H^q_{\text{et}}(Y, \mathcal{F})) \implies H^{p+q}_{\text{et}}(X, \mathcal{F})$$

This is one of the most important computational tools in etale cohomology.
</Example>

<Example id="hochschild-serre-example" title="Computing with the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence">
Let $k$ be a field, $X = \operatorname{Spec}(k)$, $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(k^{\text{sep}})$, $G = G_k = \operatorname{Gal}(k^{\text{sep}}/k)$. For $\mathcal{F} = \mathbb{G}_m$:

$$E_2^{p,q} = H^p(G_k, H^q_{\text{et}}(\operatorname{Spec}(k^{\text{sep}}), \mathbb{G}_m))$$

Since $H^0(\operatorname{Spec}(k^{\text{sep}}), \mathbb{G}_m) = (k^{\text{sep}})^\times$ and $H^q = 0$ for $q > 0$ (Spec of a separably closed field), the spectral sequence degenerates to

$$H^p_{\text{et}}(\operatorname{Spec}(k), \mathbb{G}_m) = H^p(G_k, (k^{\text{sep}})^\times)$$

This gives $H^1 = 0$ (Hilbert 90) and $H^2 = \operatorname{Br}(k)$ (the Brauer group equals the Galois cohomology $H^2(G_k, (k^{\text{sep}})^\times)$).
</Example>

<Example id="etale-descent-picard" title="Picard groups via etale descent">
For a scheme $X$ and an etale cover $\{U_i \to X\}$, the Picard group $\operatorname{Pic}(X)$ can be computed via the Cech complex:

$$\prod_i \mathcal{O}(U_i)^\times \to \prod_{i,j} \mathcal{O}(U_i \times_X U_j)^\times \to \prod_{i,j,k} \mathcal{O}(U_i \times_X U_j \times_X U_k)^\times$$

with $\operatorname{Pic}(X) = \check{H}^1(\{U_i\}, \mathbb{G}_m)$. This is the standard description: line bundles are classified by transition functions (1-cocycles) modulo coboundaries.

For $X = \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ with the etale cover $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]) \to \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ (after inverting appropriate primes), one can compute $\operatorname{Pic}(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]) = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ (the class group of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})$).
</Example>

## Etale Descent and Algebraic Stacks

<Remark title="Connection to Deligne-Mumford stacks">
Etale descent is the foundation of **Deligne-Mumford stacks**. A Deligne-Mumford stack is a stack $\mathcal{X}$ for the etale topology with:

1. Representable diagonal.
2. An etale surjection $U \to \mathcal{X}$ from a scheme $U$.

The existence of an etale atlas means that $\mathcal{X}$ can be "covered" by a scheme in the etale topology, and the descent data for this cover (encoded in the groupoid $U \times_{\mathcal{X}} U \rightrightarrows U$) determines $\mathcal{X}$.

The moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_g$ of curves of genus $g \geq 2$ is a Deligne-Mumford stack: it has an etale atlas (a Hilbert scheme parametrizing embedded curves) and the automorphism groups of objects are finite (etale, since curves of genus $\geq 2$ have finite automorphism groups).

For stacks where the automorphism groups are smooth but not etale (e.g., $BG$ for a smooth group scheme $G$), one needs the fppf or smooth topology, leading to **Artin stacks**.
</Remark>

## Summary

<Remark title="Key results of etale descent">
1. Etale descent for **quasi-coherent sheaves** is effective (as a special case of fpqc descent).

2. Etale descent for **separated schemes** is effective (Artin's theorem).

3. **Galois descent** is the special case for Galois covers, connecting to classical Galois theory and semilinear algebra.

4. The **Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence** computes etale cohomology via Galois cohomology, providing the main computational tool.

5. **Algebraic spaces** are defined so that etale descent is effective by construction, extending the category of schemes.

6. **Deligne-Mumford stacks** are stacks for the etale topology, and their definition relies on the effectiveness of etale descent for the relevant geometric objects.
