# Artin's Criteria for Algebraicity

Artin's representability criteria provide a systematic set of conditions under which a functor (or stack) is algebraic. These criteria reduce the problem of proving algebraicity to verifiable deformation-theoretic and set-theoretic conditions, and they are the workhorse behind almost all existence results for moduli spaces and moduli stacks.

## 1. Artin's Axioms

<Theorem title="Artin's Criteria for Algebraic Stacks (1974)">
Let $S$ be an excellent scheme and $\mathcal{X}$ a category fibered in groupoids over $(\mathsf{Sch}/S)_{\mathrm{fppf}}$. Then $\mathcal{X}$ is an algebraic stack locally of finite presentation over $S$ if and only if the following conditions hold:

1. **Stack condition**: $\mathcal{X}$ is a stack for the fppf (or etale) topology.

2. **Limit preservation**: $\mathcal{X}$ is **locally of finite presentation**, i.e., for any filtered inverse system $\lbrace T_i \rbrace$ of affine $S$-schemes with limit $T = \varprojlim T_i$:
$$\varinjlim \mathcal{X}(T_i) \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathcal{X}(T)$$

3. **Deformation theory (Schlessinger's conditions)**: For any local Artinian $S$-algebra $A$ and small extension $A' \to A$, the natural functor satisfies certain formal properties (existence of a cotangent complex).

4. **Effectivity of formal deformations (Grothendieck's existence)**: Formal deformations are effective, i.e., compatible systems of deformations over $A/\mathfrak{m}^n$ arise from algebraic deformations.

5. **Openness of versality**: If $\hat{\xi}$ is a formal versal deformation at a point $x \in \mathcal{X}$, then the locus where it remains versal is open.
</Theorem>

## 2. Detailed Conditions

<Definition title="Small Extension">
A **small extension** in $\mathsf{Art}_k$ is a surjection $A' \to A$ of Artinian local $k$-algebras with kernel $I$ satisfying $\mathfrak{m}_{A'} \cdot I = 0$. The kernel $I$ is then a $k$-vector space. The fundamental small extension is $k[\varepsilon]/(\varepsilon^2) \to k$.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Deformation Situation">
A **deformation situation** consists of a diagram:
$$0 \to M \to A' \to A \to 0$$
where $A' \to A$ is a small extension of Artinian local rings and $M = \ker(A' \to A)$ is an $A/\mathfrak{m}_A \cong k$-module. Given $\xi \in \mathcal{X}(A)$, we ask:
- Does $\xi$ lift to $\xi' \in \mathcal{X}(A')$?
- If so, what is the set of lifts?
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Schlessinger-Type Conditions">
For a functor $\mathcal{X}$ satisfying Artin's axioms, at each point $\xi_0 \in \mathcal{X}(k)$, there exist $k$-vector spaces $T_i$ (for $i = -1, 0, 1$) and functorial maps such that for each deformation situation:
- There is an **obstruction class** $\mathrm{ob}(\xi, A' \to A) \in T_1 \otimes_k M$ whose vanishing is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a lift.
- When the obstruction vanishes, the set of lifts is a **torsor** under $T_0 \otimes_k M$.
- The automorphisms of any lift form a group isomorphic to $T_{-1} \otimes_k M$.

These $T_i$ are the cohomology groups of the cotangent complex restricted to $\xi_0$.
</Theorem>

## 3. Examples of Verifying Artin's Criteria

<Example title="Moduli of Curves $\mathcal{M}_g$">
To show $\mathcal{M}_g$ is algebraic via Artin's criteria:

1. **Stack**: Descent for flat proper morphisms with connected fibers is effective in the fppf topology.

2. **Finite presentation**: A smooth curve of genus $g$ over $\varprojlim T_i$ spreads out to some $T_i$ (standard limit arguments for finitely presented morphisms).

3. **Deformation theory**: $T_{-1} = H^0(C, T_C) = 0$ (for $g \geq 2$), $T_0 = H^1(C, T_C) \cong k^{3g-3}$, $T_1 = H^2(C, T_C) = 0$. Schlessinger's conditions hold.

4. **Effectivity**: By Grothendieck's formal GAGA, a compatible system of curves over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k[[t]]/t^n$ algebraizes to a curve over $\mathrm{Spec}\, k[[t]]$.

5. **Openness of versality**: Follows from the theory of the Hilbert scheme and openness of smoothness.
</Example>

<Example title="Moduli of Vector Bundles $\mathrm{Bun}_n(C)$">
For a smooth projective curve $C$, the stack $\mathrm{Bun}_n(C)$ of rank-$n$ vector bundles satisfies Artin's criteria:

1. **Stack**: Vector bundles satisfy fppf descent.
2. **Finite presentation**: Coherent sheaves over limits spread out.
3. **Deformation theory**: For a bundle $\mathcal{E}$: $T_{-1} = \mathrm{End}(\mathcal{E})$, $T_0 = \mathrm{Ext}^1(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{E}) = H^1(C, \mathcal{E}nd(\mathcal{E}))$, $T_1 = H^2(C, \mathcal{E}nd(\mathcal{E})) = 0$ (since $\dim C = 1$). Unobstructed!
4. **Effectivity**: Formal GAGA for coherent sheaves.
5. **Openness**: Standard argument.

Hence $\mathrm{Bun}_n(C)$ is a smooth algebraic stack of dimension $n^2(g-1)$ (when non-empty).
</Example>

<Example title="Picard Stack">
The Picard stack $\mathcal{P}ic_{X/S}$ parametrizing line bundles on $X/S$:
- $T_{-1} = H^0(X, \mathcal{O}_X) = k$ (scalars, corresponding to $\mathbb{G}_m$-automorphisms).
- $T_0 = H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ (first-order deformations of a line bundle).
- $T_1 = H^2(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ (obstructions).

By Artin's criteria, $\mathcal{P}ic_{X/S}$ is an algebraic stack. The rigidification (killing the $\mathbb{G}_m$-automorphisms) gives the Picard scheme $\mathrm{Pic}_{X/S}$, which is an algebraic space (or scheme under mild assumptions).
</Example>

<Example title="Moduli of Stable Maps">
The Kontsevich moduli stack $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}(X, \beta)$ of stable maps from $n$-pointed genus-$g$ curves to a target variety $X$ representing a class $\beta \in H_2(X, \mathbb{Z})$. Artin's criteria verify algebraicity:
- Deformation theory: $T_0 = H^0(C, f^*T_X)$ balanced against $T_1 = H^1(C, f^*T_X)$.
- The expected dimension is $\dim X (1-g) + \int_\beta c_1(T_X) + 3g - 3 + n$.
- Effectivity follows from GAGA.
</Example>

## 4. The Effectivity Condition

<Definition title="Formal Object">
A **formal object** of $\mathcal{X}$ over a complete local ring $\hat{R} = \varprojlim R/\mathfrak{m}^n$ is a compatible system $\lbrace \xi_n \in \mathcal{X}(R/\mathfrak{m}^n) \rbrace_{n \geq 1}$ with $\xi_n|_{R/\mathfrak{m}^{n-1}} \cong \xi_{n-1}$.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Grothendieck Existence Theorem">
If $f: X \to \mathrm{Spec}\, R$ is a proper morphism (with $R$ a complete local Noetherian ring), then the functor
$$\mathsf{Coh}(X) \to \varprojlim \mathsf{Coh}(X_n)$$
is an equivalence of categories, where $X_n = X \times_{\mathrm{Spec}\, R} \mathrm{Spec}\, R/\mathfrak{m}^n$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Effectivity for Curves">
A compatible system of curves $\lbrace C_n \to \mathrm{Spec}\, k[t]/(t^n) \rbrace$ algebraizes to a curve $\mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{Spec}\, k[[t]]$ by Grothendieck's existence theorem applied to the embedding $C_n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^N_{k[t]/(t^n)}$ via the $n$-canonical embedding.
</Example>

<Example title="Non-Effectivity for Non-Proper Situations">
Consider formal deformations of the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1$. The formal deformation $\mathrm{Spec}\, k[[t]][x]/(x^2 - t)$ over $k[[t]]$ gives a family of smooth affine curves. But formal deformations of non-proper schemes need not algebraize in general. The effectivity condition in Artin's criteria handles this subtlety.
</Example>

## 5. Openness of Versality

<Definition title="Versal Deformation">
A deformation $\xi \in \mathcal{X}(\mathrm{Spec}\, R)$ is **versal** at a closed point $s \in \mathrm{Spec}\, R$ if for every deformation situation, every deformation over $A$ lifts (not necessarily uniquely) to $A'$ via a map from $R$. It is **miniversal** (or **semi-universal**) if the induced map on tangent spaces is an isomorphism.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Openness of Versality">
If a morphism $U \to \mathcal{X}$ is versal at a point $u \in U$, then it is versal in a Zariski open neighborhood of $u$. This is the condition that ensures one can construct a smooth atlas from local versal deformations.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Versality for Curves">
Given a versal family of curves $\mathcal{C} \to B$ over a smooth base $B$ at a point $b_0 \in B$, the versality is open: there exists an open $U \ni b_0$ in $B$ such that $\mathcal{C}_U \to U$ is a versal family for all fibers simultaneously. The map $U \to \mathcal{M}_g$ is then smooth, providing a smooth atlas.
</Example>

## 6. Artin's Criteria for Algebraic Spaces

<Theorem title="Artin's Criteria for Algebraic Spaces">
A functor $F: (\mathsf{Sch}/S)^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathsf{Sets}$ is an algebraic space locally of finite presentation over $S$ if:
1. $F$ is a sheaf for the etale topology.
2. $F$ is locally of finite presentation.
3. The deformation theory conditions hold (with $T_{-1} = 0$, since there are no automorphisms for functors valued in sets).
4. Formal deformations are effective.
5. Openness of versality.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Picard Scheme via Artin's Criteria">
The Picard functor $\mathrm{Pic}_{X/S}$ (after rigidification) satisfies Artin's criteria for algebraic spaces. The tangent space is $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$, obstructions lie in $H^2(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$, and there are no automorphisms after rigidification.
</Example>

<Example title="Hilbert Scheme via Artin (Alternative Proof)">
One can re-prove Grothendieck's representability of the Hilbert functor using Artin's criteria:
- The tangent space at $[Z]$ is $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{I}_Z, \mathcal{O}_Z)$.
- Obstructions lie in $\mathrm{Ext}^1(\mathcal{I}_Z, \mathcal{O}_Z)$.
- No automorphisms: $T_{-1} = \mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{O}_Z, \mathcal{O}_Z) / k = 0$ (after subtracting the identity).
- Effectivity by Grothendieck's existence theorem.
</Example>

## 7. Comparison: DM vs. Artin Stacks

<Remark title="When is a Stack DM?">
An algebraic (Artin) stack $\mathcal{X}$ is Deligne-Mumford if and only if the diagonal $\Delta: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X}$ is unramified. Equivalently:
- The automorphism group scheme $\mathrm{Aut}_{\mathcal{X}}(\xi)$ is **etale** (hence finite, if proper) for every object $\xi$.
- In the deformation theory: $T_{-1} = 0$ (no infinitesimal automorphisms).

If additionally $\mathrm{Aut}_{\mathcal{X}}(\xi)$ is always trivial, then $\mathcal{X}$ is an algebraic space.
</Remark>

<Example title="DM vs. Artin Comparison Table">
| Stack | $T_{-1}$ | Type |
|-------|----------|------|
| $\mathcal{M}_g$ ($g \geq 2$) | $H^0(C, T_C) = 0$ | Deligne-Mumford |
| $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$ | $H^0(E, T_E) = 0$ (using marked point) | Deligne-Mumford |
| $\mathcal{M}_0 = B\mathrm{PGL}_2$ | $\mathrm{Lie}(\mathrm{PGL}_2) \neq 0$ | Artin, not DM |
| $\mathrm{Bun}_n(C)$ | $\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{E}) \neq 0$ | Artin, not DM |
| $\mathrm{Hilb}^P_{X/S}$ | 0 (subschemes) | Scheme |
| $\mathcal{P}ic_{X/S}$ | $H^0(\mathcal{O}_X) = k$ ($\mathbb{G}_m$ auts) | Artin, not DM |
</Example>

<Example title="Applying Artin's Criteria to Quotient Stacks">
For a quotient stack $[X/G]$ where $G$ is a smooth group scheme acting on a finite-type $S$-scheme $X$:
- The stack condition holds because $G$-torsors satisfy descent.
- Finite presentation follows from finite type of $X$ and $G$.
- Deformation theory: $T_{-1}$ is the Lie algebra of the stabilizer, $T_0$ is the normal space to the orbit, $T_1$ is related to $H^1$ of the normal sheaf.
- Effectivity and openness follow from the algebraicity of $X$ and $G$.

Hence $[X/G]$ is always an algebraic stack when $G$ is smooth and $X$ is of finite type over $S$.
</Example>
