# 아르키메데스 성질의 증명 (Proof of the Archimedean Property)

The Archimedean property is one of the first important consequences of the completeness axiom. It ensures that the natural numbers are unbounded and, equivalently, that for any positive real number $\varepsilon$, the sequence $1/n$ eventually becomes smaller than $\varepsilon$. The proof uses the completeness axiom (existence of supremum) via a proof by contradiction.

## Statement

<Theorem title="Archimedean Property" number="1.5">
**Version 1.** For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > x$.

Equivalently, $\mathbb{N}$ is not bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$.

**Version 2.** For any $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ with $x > 0$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $nx > y$.
</Theorem>

<Remark>
Version 1 and Version 2 are equivalent. Version 2 follows from Version 1 by applying it to $y/x$ (which exists since $x > 0$). Version 1 follows from Version 2 by taking $x = 1$ and $y = x$.
</Remark>

## Proof of Version 1 (by Contradiction)

<Proof>
We prove that $\mathbb{N}$ is not bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$.

**Step 1: Assume for contradiction that $\mathbb{N}$ is bounded above.**

Suppose there exists $M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $n \leq M$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. In other words, $M$ is an upper bound of $\mathbb{N}$.

**Step 2: Apply the completeness axiom.**

The set $\mathbb{N}$ is nonempty (since $1 \in \mathbb{N}$) and bounded above (by assumption). By the completeness axiom of $\mathbb{R}$, the supremum $\alpha = \sup \mathbb{N}$ exists.

**Step 3: Show that $\alpha - 1$ is not an upper bound.**

Since $\alpha = \sup \mathbb{N}$, the number $\alpha - 1$ is strictly less than $\alpha$ and therefore is **not** an upper bound of $\mathbb{N}$. (The supremum is the **least** upper bound, so anything smaller fails to be an upper bound.)

Hence there exists $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that

$$n_0 > \alpha - 1.$$

**Step 4: Derive a contradiction.**

Since $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$, we also have $n_0 + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$. From $n_0 > \alpha - 1$, we get

$$n_0 + 1 > \alpha.$$

But $n_0 + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\alpha$ is an upper bound of $\mathbb{N}$, so $n_0 + 1 \leq \alpha$. This is a contradiction.

**Step 5: Conclusion.**

The assumption that $\mathbb{N}$ is bounded above leads to a contradiction. Therefore $\mathbb{N}$ is not bounded above: for every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n > x$.
</Proof>

## Key Observations

<Remark>
The proof critically uses the **completeness axiom** -- specifically, the existence of $\sup \mathbb{N}$ under the assumption that $\mathbb{N}$ is bounded. Without completeness, the Archimedean property can fail. In fact, there exist non-Archimedean ordered fields (see Example 4 below).

The logical structure is: completeness $\Rightarrow$ Archimedean property. The converse is false: $\mathbb{Q}$ is Archimedean but not complete.
</Remark>

---

## Proof of Version 2

<Proof>
Let $x > 0$ and $y \in \mathbb{R}$. We must find $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $nx > y$.

If $y \leq 0$, then $n = 1$ works since $1 \cdot x = x > 0 \geq y$.

If $y > 0$, consider the real number $y/x > 0$. By Version 1, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n > y/x$. Multiplying both sides by $x > 0$ gives $nx > y$.
</Proof>

---

## Important Corollaries

<Theorem title="Corollary: Infimum of 1/n" number="1.6">
$\inf\{1/n : n \in \mathbb{N}\} = 0$.

Equivalently, for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $1/n < \varepsilon$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
Let $S = \{1/n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$.

**$0$ is a lower bound**: For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $1/n > 0$, so $0$ is a lower bound of $S$.

**$0$ is the greatest lower bound**: Let $\varepsilon > 0$. By the Archimedean property (Version 2 with $x = \varepsilon$ and $y = 1$), there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n\varepsilon > 1$, i.e., $1/n < \varepsilon$. Hence $1/n \in S$ and $1/n < 0 + \varepsilon$. By the epsilon characterization of infimum, $\inf S = 0$.
</Proof>

<Remark>
This corollary is used throughout analysis. Every time we write "choose $n$ large enough that $1/n < \varepsilon$," we are invoking the Archimedean property.
</Remark>

## Examples

<Example title="Archimedean property for large numbers">
1. Let $x = 10^{100}$ (a googol). The Archimedean property guarantees there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n > 10^{100}$. Of course, $n = 10^{100} + 1$ works. The point is not that this is surprising for specific numbers, but that the property holds for **every** real number, including those we cannot write down explicitly.
</Example>

<Example title="Making nx exceed y">
2. Let $x = 0.001$ and $y = 1000$. We need $n$ with $0.001 \cdot n > 1000$, i.e., $n > 1{,}000{,}000$. So $n = 1{,}000{,}001$ works. In general, $n = \lfloor y/x \rfloor + 1$ always works.
</Example>

<Example title="Convergence of 1/n to zero">
3. The sequence $a_n = 1/n$ converges to $0$. To prove this formally: for any $\varepsilon > 0$, the Archimedean property gives $N \in \mathbb{N}$ with $1/N < \varepsilon$. Then for all $n \geq N$, $|a_n - 0| = 1/n \leq 1/N < \varepsilon$.
</Example>

<Example title="Non-Archimedean ordered fields">
4. Consider the ordered field $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon)$ of rational functions in an indeterminate $\varepsilon$, ordered so that $\varepsilon$ is "infinitely small" (positive but less than every positive rational). Then $1/\varepsilon$ is "infinitely large" -- there is no $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n > 1/\varepsilon$. This is a non-Archimedean ordered field, showing that the Archimedean property does not follow from the ordered field axioms alone.
</Example>

<Example title="Application to floor function">
5. The **floor function** $\lfloor x \rfloor = \max\{n \in \mathbb{Z} : n \leq x\}$ is well-defined for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. This relies on the Archimedean property: since $\mathbb{N}$ is unbounded, there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ with $n > |x|$, so the set $\{k \in \mathbb{Z} : k \leq x\}$ is bounded above and nonempty (it contains $-n$). The well-ordering of $\mathbb{Z}$ from above (or completeness) then gives the maximum.
</Example>

<Example title="Density and the Archimedean property">
6. The Archimedean property is the essential ingredient in proving the [유리수의 조밀성](/analysis/ch01-real-numbers/theorems/t02-density-of-rationals). Given $a < b$, the Archimedean property provides $n$ with $1/n < b - a$, which is the crucial first step. See the [유리수 조밀성의 증명](/analysis/ch01-real-numbers/proofs/p02-density-proof) for the complete argument.
</Example>

## Summary of the Proof Structure

<Remark>
The proof of the Archimedean property follows a pattern that recurs throughout real analysis:

1. **Assume the negation**: suppose the desired conclusion fails.
2. **Apply completeness**: the negation gives a bounded set, so the supremum exists.
3. **Use the supremum characterization**: find an element close to the supremum.
4. **Derive a contradiction**: produce an element that exceeds the supremum.

This "completeness + contradiction" pattern appears in the proofs of the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the Bolzano--Weierstrass Theorem, the Extreme Value Theorem, and many others.
