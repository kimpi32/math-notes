# 도함수 (Derivative)

The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function. In rigorous analysis, it is defined as a limit, making precise the intuition of "slope of the tangent line."

## Definition

<Definition title="Derivative at a point" number="5.1">
Let $f : (a, b) \to \mathbb{R}$ and $c \in (a, b)$. The **derivative** of $f$ at $c$ is

$$f'(c) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c},$$

provided this limit exists. If it exists, we say $f$ is **differentiable** at $c$.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Derivative function" number="5.2">
If $f$ is differentiable at every point of $(a, b)$, the function $f' : (a, b) \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $c \mapsto f'(c)$ is called the **derivative** of $f$ (or the **derived function**).
</Definition>

---

## Basic examples via the definition

<Example title="Derivative of x squared">
1. $f(x) = x^2$, compute $f'(c)$:

$$f'(c) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(c+h)^2 - c^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2ch + h^2}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} (2c + h) = 2c.$$

So $f'(x) = 2x$.
</Example>

<Example title="Derivative of 1/x">
2. $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ for $x \neq 0$:

$$f'(c) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{1}{c+h} - \frac{1}{c}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c - (c+h)}{h \cdot c(c+h)} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{-1}{c(c+h)} = -\frac{1}{c^2}.$$
</Example>

<Example title="Derivative of sqrt(x)">
3. $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ for $x > 0$:

$$f'(c) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{c+h} - \sqrt{c}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{\sqrt{c+h} + \sqrt{c}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{c}}.$$
</Example>

<Example title="Derivative of |x| at 0">
4. $f(x) = |x|$. At $c = 0$:

$$\lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{|h|}{h} = 1, \quad \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{|h|}{h} = -1.$$

The one-sided limits differ, so $f'(0)$ does not exist. The function $|x|$ is continuous but not differentiable at $0$.
</Example>

## Differentiation rules

<Theorem title="Differentiation rules">
If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at $c$, then:
1. **Sum**: $(f + g)'(c) = f'(c) + g'(c)$.
2. **Scalar multiple**: $(\alpha f)'(c) = \alpha f'(c)$.
3. **Product**: $(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c)$.
4. **Quotient**: $(f/g)'(c) = \frac{f'(c)g(c) - f(c)g'(c)}{g(c)^2}$, provided $g(c) \neq 0$.
5. **Chain rule**: If $g$ is differentiable at $c$ and $f$ is differentiable at $g(c)$, then $(f \circ g)'(c) = f'(g(c)) \cdot g'(c)$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Product rule from definition">
5. To prove the product rule from the definition:

$$\frac{f(x)g(x) - f(c)g(c)}{x - c} = f(x) \cdot \frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c} + g(c) \cdot \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c}.$$

As $x \to c$: $f(x) \to f(c)$ (differentiable implies continuous), so the limit is $f(c)g'(c) + g(c)f'(c)$.
</Example>

<Example title="Chain rule application">
6. $f(x) = \sin(x^2)$: $f'(x) = \cos(x^2) \cdot 2x = 2x\cos(x^2)$.

$g(x) = e^{\sin x}$: $g'(x) = e^{\sin x} \cdot \cos x$.
</Example>

## Higher-order derivatives

<Definition title="Higher derivatives" number="5.3">
The $n$-th derivative $f^{(n)}$ is defined inductively: $f^{(0)} = f$, $f^{(n)} = (f^{(n-1)})'$. We also write $f''$, $f'''$, etc. A function is **$C^n$** if $f^{(n)}$ exists and is continuous. It is **$C^\infty$** (smooth) if all derivatives exist.
</Definition>

<Example title="Higher derivatives of polynomials">
7. $f(x) = x^n$: $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$, $f''(x) = n(n-1)x^{n-2}$, $\ldots$, $f^{(n)}(x) = n!$, $f^{(n+1)}(x) = 0$.
</Example>

<Example title="Higher derivatives of exponential">
8. $f(x) = e^x$: $f^{(n)}(x) = e^x$ for all $n \geq 0$. The exponential is its own derivative at every order.
</Example>

## One-sided derivatives

<Definition title="One-sided derivatives" number="5.4">
The **right derivative** $f'_+(c) = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(c+h) - f(c)}{h}$ and **left derivative** $f'_-(c) = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(c+h) - f(c)}{h}$. The derivative $f'(c)$ exists if and only if both one-sided derivatives exist and are equal.
</Definition>

<Example title="One-sided derivatives of |x|">
9. $f(x) = |x|$ at $c = 0$: $f'_+(0) = 1$ and $f'_-(0) = -1$. Since they differ, $f'(0)$ does not exist.
</Example>

---

## Local extrema and the derivative

<Theorem title="Interior extremum theorem">
If $f$ is differentiable at an interior point $c$ and $f$ has a local extremum at $c$, then $f'(c) = 0$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Critical points">
10. $f(x) = x^3 - 3x$ on $\mathbb{R}$: $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3 = 3(x-1)(x+1)$. Critical points at $x = \pm 1$. $f(-1) = 2$ is a local max, $f(1) = -2$ is a local min.
</Example>

<Example title="Critical point without extremum">
11. $f(x) = x^3$: $f'(0) = 0$ but $x = 0$ is neither a local max nor min (inflection point). The converse of the interior extremum theorem is false.
</Example>

---

## Derivative as a linear approximation

<Remark>
Differentiability at $c$ means $f(c + h) = f(c) + f'(c) \cdot h + o(h)$ as $h \to 0$, where $o(h)/h \to 0$. The linear function $L(h) = f(c) + f'(c) \cdot h$ is the **best linear approximation** to $f$ near $c$. This is the starting point for Taylor's theorem.
</Remark>

<Example title="Linear approximation">
12. $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ near $c = 4$: $f(4) = 2$, $f'(4) = \frac{1}{4}$. So $\sqrt{x} \approx 2 + \frac{1}{4}(x - 4)$ near $x = 4$. For example, $\sqrt{4.1} \approx 2 + 0.025 = 2.025$ (actual: $2.02485\ldots$).
</Example>
