# 미분가능성 (Differentiability)

Differentiability is a stronger condition than continuity. Understanding the precise relationship between these concepts, and the ways differentiability can fail, is a central theme in real analysis.

## Differentiable implies continuous

<Theorem title="Differentiable implies continuous" number="5.1">
If $f$ is differentiable at $c$, then $f$ is continuous at $c$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
We need to show $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$. Write:

$$f(x) - f(c) = \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} \cdot (x - c).$$

As $x \to c$: the first factor $\to f'(c)$ and the second factor $\to 0$. So $f(x) - f(c) \to f'(c) \cdot 0 = 0$, meaning $f(x) \to f(c)$.
</Proof>

<Remark>
The converse is **false**: continuous does not imply differentiable. The classic counterexample is $f(x) = |x|$ at $x = 0$.
</Remark>

## Continuous but not differentiable: examples

<Example title="Absolute value">
1. $f(x) = |x|$: continuous everywhere, not differentiable at $x = 0$. The graph has a "corner."
</Example>

<Example title="Cube root">
2. $f(x) = x^{1/3}$: continuous everywhere, but $f'(0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h^{1/3}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} h^{-2/3} = +\infty$. The derivative is infinite (vertical tangent), so $f$ is not differentiable at $0$ in the usual sense.
</Example>

<Example title="Piecewise linear function">
3. $f(x) = |x - 1| + |x + 1|$: not differentiable at $x = \pm 1$ (corners). Differentiable everywhere else.
</Example>

## The Weierstrass function: continuous nowhere differentiable

<Example title="Weierstrass function">
4. There exist functions that are continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. The Weierstrass function is

$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a^n \cos(b^n \pi x)$$

where $0 < a < 1$, $b$ is a positive odd integer, and $ab > 1 + \frac{3\pi}{2}$. This is continuous (uniform limit of continuous functions) but differentiable at no point.

The existence of such functions was shocking when first discovered (1872). It shows that "most" continuous functions are not differentiable (in a precise sense related to Baire category).
</Example>

## Characterization of differentiability

<Definition title="Caratheodory characterization" number="5.5">
$f$ is differentiable at $c$ if and only if there exists a function $\varphi$ continuous at $c$ such that

$$f(x) - f(c) = \varphi(x)(x - c) \quad \text{for all } x.$$

In this case, $f'(c) = \varphi(c)$.
</Definition>

<Example title="Caratheodory for x squared">
5. $f(x) = x^2$: $f(x) - f(c) = x^2 - c^2 = (x + c)(x - c)$. So $\varphi(x) = x + c$, which is continuous, and $\varphi(c) = 2c = f'(c)$.
</Example>

<Example title="Caratheodory for |x|">
6. $f(x) = |x|$: $f(x) - f(0) = |x| = \frac{|x|}{x} \cdot x$ for $x \neq 0$. So $\varphi(x) = |x|/x = \operatorname{sgn}(x)$ for $x \neq 0$. But $\operatorname{sgn}$ is not continuous at $0$, confirming non-differentiability.
</Example>

## Differentiability and linear approximation

<Theorem title="Best linear approximation">
$f$ is differentiable at $c$ if and only if there exists a constant $A$ such that

$$f(c + h) = f(c) + Ah + r(h), \quad \text{where } \frac{r(h)}{h} \to 0 \text{ as } h \to 0.$$

The constant $A$ equals $f'(c)$, and $r(h) = o(h)$ is the error term.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Linear approximation error">
7. $f(x) = e^x$ at $c = 0$: $f(h) = 1 + h + r(h)$ where $r(h) = e^h - 1 - h = \frac{h^2}{2} + \cdots$. Then $r(h)/h = h/2 + \cdots \to 0$. So $f'(0) = 1$.
</Example>

<Example title="Non-differentiable: error term too large">
8. $f(x) = |x|$ at $c = 0$: $f(h) = |h| = 0 + A \cdot h + r(h)$. For this to work, we need $|h| = Ah + r(h)$ with $r(h)/h \to 0$. For $h > 0$: $r(h)/h = (1 - A)$. For $h < 0$: $r(h)/h = (-1 - A)$. These can only both be $0$ if $A = 1$ and $A = -1$ simultaneously. Impossible.
</Example>

## Differentiability on intervals

<Definition title="Differentiability on intervals" number="5.6">
$f$ is differentiable on an open interval $(a, b)$ if $f'(c)$ exists for every $c \in (a, b)$. On a closed interval $[a, b]$, we require differentiability on $(a, b)$ and optionally one-sided derivatives at the endpoints.
</Definition>

<Example title="Differentiable on (0, infinity)">
9. $f(x) = x \ln x$ for $x > 0$: $f'(x) = \ln x + 1$. Differentiable on $(0, \infty)$, with $f'(x) = 0$ at $x = 1/e$.
</Example>

---

## Continuity of the derivative

<Example title="Derivative need not be continuous">
10. $f(x) = x^2 \sin(1/x)$ for $x \neq 0$, $f(0) = 0$.

At $x = 0$: $f'(0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h^2 \sin(1/h)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} h \sin(1/h) = 0$.

For $x \neq 0$: $f'(x) = 2x\sin(1/x) - \cos(1/x)$.

As $x \to 0$: $2x\sin(1/x) \to 0$ but $\cos(1/x)$ oscillates. So $\lim_{x \to 0} f'(x)$ does not exist, hence $f'$ is not continuous at $0$ even though $f'(0)$ exists.
</Example>

<Remark>
This shows the derivative $f'$ exists everywhere but is discontinuous at $0$. Darboux's theorem guarantees that $f'$ still satisfies the intermediate value property, even though it is discontinuous.
</Remark>

---

## Darboux's theorem

<Theorem title="Darboux's theorem (IVT for derivatives)">
If $f$ is differentiable on $[a, b]$, then $f'$ has the intermediate value property: if $v$ lies between $f'(a)$ and $f'(b)$, there exists $c \in (a, b)$ with $f'(c) = v$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Darboux application">
11. The function with $f'(x) = 2x\sin(1/x) - \cos(1/x)$ (from Example 10) takes all intermediate values between any two of its values, despite being discontinuous at $0$.
</Example>

---

## Infinite differentiability and real-analyticity

<Example title="Smooth but not analytic">
12. $f(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ for $x \neq 0$, $f(0) = 0$. This is $C^\infty$ (infinitely differentiable), and $f^{(n)}(0) = 0$ for all $n$. So the Taylor series at $0$ is identically $0$, but $f(x) > 0$ for $x \neq 0$. This function is smooth but **not real-analytic** at $0$: its Taylor series does not converge to $f$.

This shows that $C^\infty$ (smooth) is strictly larger than $C^\omega$ (real-analytic).
</Example>
