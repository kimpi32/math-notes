# 연속함수 (Continuous Function)

Continuity formalizes the intuition that "small changes in input produce small changes in output." It is the central concept bridging limits and the deeper theorems of analysis.

## Definition

<Definition title="Continuity at a point" number="4.1">
Let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and $c \in A$. The function $f$ is **continuous at $c$** if:

$$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \quad \exists \delta > 0, \quad \forall x \in A: \quad |x - c| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon.$$

Equivalently (if $c$ is a limit point of $A$): $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$.

If $c$ is an isolated point of $A$ (not a limit point), then $f$ is automatically continuous at $c$.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Continuity on a set" number="4.2">
$f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is **continuous on** $A$ if it is continuous at every point $c \in A$.
</Definition>

<Remark>
Continuity at $c$ requires three things:
1. $f(c)$ is defined.
2. $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ exists.
3. The limit equals $f(c)$.

Compare with the definition of a limit, which does not require $f(c)$ to be defined.
</Remark>

## Sequential characterization

<Theorem title="Sequential criterion for continuity">
$f$ is continuous at $c$ if and only if for every sequence $(x_n)$ in $A$ with $x_n \to c$, we have $f(x_n) \to f(c)$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Using sequences to prove continuity">
1. $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous at every $c \in \mathbb{R}$. If $x_n \to c$, then $f(x_n) = x_n^2 \to c^2 = f(c)$ by the algebraic limit theorem.
</Example>

<Example title="Using sequences to prove discontinuity">
2. The Dirichlet function $f(x) = 1$ for $x \in \mathbb{Q}$, $f(x) = 0$ for $x \notin \mathbb{Q}$ is discontinuous everywhere. For any $c$, take a sequence of rationals $r_n \to c$ and a sequence of irrationals $s_n \to c$. Then $f(r_n) = 1$ and $f(s_n) = 0$.
</Example>

---

## Basic examples

<Example title="Polynomial continuity (epsilon-delta)">
3. $f(x) = 2x + 3$ is continuous at $c = 1$.

Let $\varepsilon > 0$. Choose $\delta = \varepsilon/2$. If $|x - 1| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(1)| = |2x + 3 - 5| = 2|x-1| < 2\delta = \varepsilon$.
</Example>

<Example title="Square root continuity">
4. $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ is continuous on $[0, \infty)$.

At $c > 0$: $|\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{c}| = \frac{|x - c|}{\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{c}} \leq \frac{|x-c|}{\sqrt{c}}$. Choose $\delta = \varepsilon \sqrt{c}$.

At $c = 0$: $|\sqrt{x}| = \sqrt{x} < \varepsilon$ when $x < \varepsilon^2 = \delta$.
</Example>

<Example title="Absolute value">
5. $f(x) = |x|$ is continuous everywhere. $||x| - |c|| \leq |x - c|$. Choose $\delta = \varepsilon$.
</Example>

## Types of discontinuity

<Definition title="Types of discontinuity" number="4.3">
If $f$ is discontinuous at $c$, the discontinuity is:
- **Removable**: $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ exists but does not equal $f(c)$ (or $f(c)$ is undefined).
- **Jump**: Both one-sided limits exist but are unequal.
- **Essential** (or oscillatory): At least one one-sided limit fails to exist.
</Definition>

<Example title="Removable discontinuity">
6. $f(x) = \frac{\sin x}{x}$ for $x \neq 0$, $f(0) = 0$. Here $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 1 \neq 0 = f(0)$. Redefining $f(0) = 1$ removes the discontinuity.
</Example>

<Example title="Jump discontinuity">
7. $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$ (floor function) has a jump discontinuity at every integer. At $n \in \mathbb{Z}$: $\lim_{x \to n^-} f = n - 1$ and $\lim_{x \to n^+} f = n$.
</Example>

<Example title="Essential discontinuity">
8. $f(x) = \sin(1/x)$ for $x \neq 0$, $f(0) = 0$. The limit $\lim_{x \to 0} \sin(1/x)$ does not exist (oscillation), so the discontinuity at $0$ is essential.
</Example>

## Algebraic properties of continuous functions

<Theorem title="Algebra of continuous functions">
If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $c$, then:
1. $f + g$ is continuous at $c$.
2. $\alpha f$ is continuous at $c$ for any $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.
3. $fg$ is continuous at $c$.
4. $f/g$ is continuous at $c$ provided $g(c) \neq 0$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Continuity of polynomials and rationals">
9. Every polynomial $p(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ (by induction on the algebra of continuous functions, starting from $f(x) = x$ and constant functions).

Every rational function $p(x)/q(x)$ is continuous wherever $q(x) \neq 0$.
</Example>

---

## Composition

<Theorem title="Continuity of compositions">
If $f$ is continuous at $c$ and $g$ is continuous at $f(c)$, then $g \circ f$ is continuous at $c$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Composition examples">
10. $f(x) = e^{\sin x}$: since $\sin$ is continuous and $\exp$ is continuous, the composition is continuous.

11. $f(x) = |\sin(x^2)|$: composition of continuous functions $x^2$, $\sin$, $|\cdot|$.
</Example>

## Thomae's function: continuous at irrationals

<Example title="Thomae's function">
12. Define $f : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) = 0$ for irrational $x$, and $f(p/q) = 1/q$ for $p/q$ in lowest terms ($q > 0$).

**Continuous at every irrational $c$**: Given $\varepsilon > 0$, only finitely many rationals $p/q$ in $[0,1]$ have $q \leq 1/\varepsilon$. So there exists $\delta > 0$ such that the only rationals within $\delta$ of $c$ have $q > 1/\varepsilon$, i.e., $f(p/q) < \varepsilon$. Since $f(c) = 0$, $|f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$.

**Discontinuous at every rational $c = p/q$**: Take irrationals $x_n \to c$ with $f(x_n) = 0 \neq 1/q = f(c)$.

This is a function continuous on the irrationals and discontinuous on the rationals.
</Example>

<Remark>
The existence of Thomae's function shows that the set of points of continuity of a function can be the irrationals $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$. A deep theorem states: the set of continuity points of any function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is always a $G_\delta$ set (a countable intersection of open sets). Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is not $G_\delta$, there is **no** function that is continuous exactly on the rationals.
</Remark>
