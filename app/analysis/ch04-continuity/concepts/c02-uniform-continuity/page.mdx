# 균등연속 (Uniform Continuity)

Uniform continuity strengthens ordinary continuity by requiring that the same $\delta$ works for all points simultaneously. This seemingly small change has profound consequences for integration and approximation.

## Definition

<Definition title="Uniform continuity" number="4.4">
A function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ is **uniformly continuous** on $A$ if:

$$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \quad \exists \delta > 0, \quad \forall x, y \in A: \quad |x - y| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(y)| < \varepsilon.$$
</Definition>

<Remark>
Compare the quantifier order with (pointwise) continuity:

**Continuity at $c$**: $\forall \varepsilon > 0$, $\exists \delta > 0$, $\forall x$: $|x - c| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$.

**Uniform continuity**: $\forall \varepsilon > 0$, $\exists \delta > 0$, $\forall x, y$: $|x - y| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - f(y)| < \varepsilon$.

In continuity, $\delta$ may depend on both $\varepsilon$ and $c$. In uniform continuity, $\delta$ depends only on $\varepsilon$. This is a **stronger** condition.
</Remark>

## Examples of uniformly continuous functions

<Example title="Linear functions">
1. $f(x) = 3x + 2$ is uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.

$|f(x) - f(y)| = 3|x - y|$. Choose $\delta = \varepsilon/3$, independent of the points.
</Example>

<Example title="Lipschitz implies uniform continuity">
2. Any **Lipschitz continuous** function (where $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq L|x - y|$ for some constant $L$) is uniformly continuous: choose $\delta = \varepsilon / L$.

Examples: $f(x) = \sin x$ ($L = 1$), $f(x) = |x|$ ($L = 1$), $f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}$ ($L = 1$).
</Example>

<Example title="sqrt(x) on [0, infinity)">
3. $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ is uniformly continuous on $[0, \infty)$.

$|\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{y}| = \frac{|x - y|}{\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}} \leq \frac{|x - y|}{\sqrt{|x-y|}} = \sqrt{|x-y|}$,

using $\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} \geq \sqrt{|x-y|}$ (which follows from $(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y})^2 \geq |x - y|$). Choose $\delta = \varepsilon^2$.
</Example>

## Non-uniformly continuous functions

<Example title="x squared on R">
4. $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous but **not** uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.

Take $x_n = n + \frac{1}{n}$ and $y_n = n$. Then $|x_n - y_n| = \frac{1}{n} \to 0$, but $|f(x_n) - f(y_n)| = |x_n^2 - n^2| = |2 + \frac{1}{n^2}| \to 2 \neq 0$.

So no single $\delta$ works for $\varepsilon = 1$.
</Example>

<Example title="sin(x squared) on R">
5. $f(x) = \sin(x^2)$ is continuous but not uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$.

Take $x_n = \sqrt{n\pi + \pi/2}$ and $y_n = \sqrt{n\pi}$. Then $|x_n - y_n| \to 0$ (since $x_n - y_n = \frac{\pi/2}{\sqrt{n\pi + \pi/2} + \sqrt{n\pi}} \to 0$), but $|f(x_n) - f(y_n)| = |\sin(n\pi + \pi/2) - \sin(n\pi)| = |(\pm 1) - 0| = 1$.
</Example>

<Example title="1/x on (0,1)">
6. $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is not uniformly continuous on $(0, 1)$.

Take $x_n = \frac{1}{n}$ and $y_n = \frac{1}{n+1}$. Then $|x_n - y_n| = \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \to 0$, but $|f(x_n) - f(y_n)| = 1$ for all $n$.
</Example>

## Sequential criterion for non-uniform continuity

<Theorem title="Negation of uniform continuity">
$f$ is **not** uniformly continuous on $A$ if and only if there exist $\varepsilon_0 > 0$ and sequences $(x_n), (y_n)$ in $A$ with $|x_n - y_n| \to 0$ but $|f(x_n) - f(y_n)| \geq \varepsilon_0$ for all $n$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Applying the negation">
7. $f(x) = x\sin(1/x)$ on $(0, 1)$: this is actually uniformly continuous (it extends continuously to $[0,1]$). The key test: does $|x_n - y_n| \to 0$ always force $|f(x_n) - f(y_n)| \to 0$?
</Example>

---

## Uniform continuity on bounded intervals

<Example title="x squared on [0, K]">
8. $f(x) = x^2$ is uniformly continuous on any bounded interval $[0, K]$. Indeed, $|x^2 - y^2| = |x+y| \cdot |x-y| \leq 2K|x-y|$. Choose $\delta = \varepsilon/(2K)$.

The failure of uniform continuity on $\mathbb{R}$ is due to the unbounded domain, not the function itself.
</Example>

<Remark>
The Heine--Cantor theorem guarantees: every continuous function on a **closed bounded** interval $[a,b]$ is uniformly continuous. See [Heine--Cantor](/analysis/ch04-continuity/theorems/t03-heine-cantor).
</Remark>

## Uniform continuity and extensions

<Theorem title="Extension to the closure">
If $f : (a, b) \to \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly continuous, then $f$ extends uniquely to a continuous function on $[a, b]$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Extension example">
9. $f(x) = x \sin(1/x)$ on $(0, 1]$ is uniformly continuous and extends to $f(0) = 0$.

10. $f(x) = \sin(1/x)$ on $(0, 1]$ is **not** uniformly continuous and does **not** extend continuously to $[0, 1]$ (the limit at $0$ does not exist).
</Example>

---

## Uniform continuity and Cauchy sequences

<Theorem title="Uniform continuity preserves Cauchy sequences">
If $f$ is uniformly continuous and $(x_n)$ is Cauchy, then $(f(x_n))$ is Cauchy.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Cauchy preservation">
11. $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ on $(0, \infty)$ is uniformly continuous. If $(x_n)$ is Cauchy in $(0, \infty)$, then $(\sqrt{x_n})$ is Cauchy. This is not automatic for merely continuous functions.

Counterexample: $f(x) = 1/x$ on $(0, 1)$. The sequence $x_n = 1/n$ is Cauchy, but $f(x_n) = n$ is not Cauchy.
</Example>

---

## Holder continuity

<Example title="Holder continuous functions">
12. A function $f$ is **Holder continuous** with exponent $\alpha \in (0, 1]$ if $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq C|x - y|^\alpha$. When $\alpha = 1$, this is Lipschitz. For $0 < \alpha < 1$, Holder continuous functions are uniformly continuous (choose $\delta = (\varepsilon/C)^{1/\alpha}$) but may not be Lipschitz.

Example: $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ on $[0,1]$ is Holder with $\alpha = 1/2$, $C = 1$: $|\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{y}| \leq |x - y|^{1/2}$.
</Example>
