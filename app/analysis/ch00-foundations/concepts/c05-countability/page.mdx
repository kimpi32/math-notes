# 가산성과 비가산성 (Countability)

Not all infinite sets have the same "size." The distinction between countable and uncountable sets is one of the most profound ideas in mathematics and has deep consequences for analysis. The existence of uncountable sets explains why $\mathbb{R}$ is fundamentally different from $\mathbb{Q}$ and underlies the necessity of measure theory.

## Finite and Infinite Sets

<Definition title="Finite and infinite sets" number="0.23">
A set $A$ is **finite** if either $A = \emptyset$ or there exists a bijection $f : \lbrace 1, 2, \ldots, n \rbrace \to A$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. In this case, we say $A$ has **cardinality** $|A| = n$ (or $|A| = 0$ if $A = \emptyset$).

A set is **infinite** if it is not finite.
</Definition>

<Example title="Finite and infinite sets">
1. $\lbrace 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 \rbrace$ is finite with cardinality $5$.
2. $\emptyset$ is finite with cardinality $0$.
3. $\mathbb{N}$ is infinite: for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the set $\lbrace 1, 2, \ldots, n \rbrace$ is a proper subset of $\mathbb{N}$.
4. The set of prime numbers is infinite (by Euclid's theorem).
</Example>

## Countable Sets

<Definition title="Countably infinite and countable" number="0.24">
A set $A$ is **countably infinite** if there exists a bijection $f : \mathbb{N} \to A$. In this case, the elements of $A$ can be listed as a sequence: $A = \lbrace f(1), f(2), f(3), \ldots \rbrace = \lbrace a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \rbrace$.

A set is **countable** if it is either finite or countably infinite. A set is **uncountable** if it is not countable.

The cardinality of a countably infinite set is denoted $\aleph_0$ (aleph-null).
</Definition>

<Remark>
Being countably infinite means we can enumerate all elements as a sequence indexed by $\mathbb{N}$. Every element appears exactly once in the listing. This is a very strong condition: it means we can "reach" every element by counting through the natural numbers.
</Remark>

## The Integers are Countable

<Example title="Countability of Z">
5. $\mathbb{Z}$ is countably infinite. We construct an explicit bijection $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ by the listing:

$$0,\; 1,\; -1,\; 2,\; -2,\; 3,\; -3,\; \ldots$$

Formally, define $f(1) = 0$ and for $n \geq 2$:

$$f(n) = \begin{cases} n/2 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\ -(n-1)/2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}. \end{cases}$$

This is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$, so $|\mathbb{Z}| = \aleph_0$.
</Example>

<Remark>
This example illustrates a surprising feature of infinite sets: $\mathbb{Z}$ is "twice as large" as $\mathbb{N}$ in an informal sense, yet they have the same cardinality. An infinite set can be in bijection with a proper subset of itself -- this is actually a **characterization** of infinite sets (Dedekind's definition).
</Remark>

## Countability of the Rationals

<Theorem title="Q is countable" number="0.5">
The set $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is countably infinite.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
It suffices to show that the set of positive rationals $\mathbb{Q}^+$ is countable, since $\mathbb{Q} = \mathbb{Q}^- \cup \lbrace 0 \rbrace \cup \mathbb{Q}^+$ and a countable union of countable sets is countable.

Arrange all positive fractions $p/q$ (with $p, q \in \mathbb{N}$) in a grid:

$$\frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots$$

$$\frac{2}{1}, \frac{2}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{4}, \ldots$$

$$\frac{3}{1}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \ldots$$

Traverse this grid along successive anti-diagonals (where $p + q$ is constant), skipping fractions that are not in lowest terms. This gives an enumeration of $\mathbb{Q}^+$:

$$\frac{1}{1},\; \frac{1}{2},\; \frac{2}{1},\; \frac{1}{3},\; \frac{3}{1},\; \frac{1}{4},\; \frac{2}{3},\; \frac{3}{2},\; \frac{4}{1},\; \ldots$$

Hence $\mathbb{Q}^+$, and therefore $\mathbb{Q}$, is countable.
</Proof>

<Example title="Other countable sets">
6. $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is countable, by the same diagonal argument: list pairs $(i, j)$ along anti-diagonals $i + j = 2, 3, 4, \ldots$
7. The set of all finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ is countable.
8. The set $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ of all polynomials with rational coefficients is countable (a countable union of countable sets $\mathbb{Q}^n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$).
</Example>

## Properties of Countable Sets

<Theorem title="Countable unions and subsets" number="0.6">
1. Every subset of a countable set is countable.
2. The union of countably many countable sets is countable: if $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$ are each countable, then $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ is countable.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
(1) Let $B \subseteq A$ where $A$ is countable. If $A$ is finite, then $B$ is finite. If $A$ is countably infinite, list $A = \lbrace a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \rbrace$. The elements of $B$ form a subsequence of this listing, which provides an injection from $B$ into $\mathbb{N}$, so $B$ is countable.

(2) List the elements of each $A_n$ as $A_n = \lbrace a_{n,1}, a_{n,2}, a_{n,3}, \ldots \rbrace$. Arrange all $a_{n,k}$ in a grid and traverse along anti-diagonals, skipping duplicates. This gives a surjection from $\mathbb{N}$ onto $\bigcup A_n$, so the union is countable.
</Proof>

<Example title="Application of countable union">
9. The set of algebraic numbers (roots of polynomials with integer coefficients) is countable. There are countably many polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ (by degree and coefficient bounds), each having finitely many roots. A countable union of finite sets is countable.
</Example>

## Uncountability of the Reals

<Theorem title="R is uncountable (Cantor, 1874)" number="0.7">
The set $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. More precisely, the interval $(0, 1)$ is uncountable.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
Suppose for contradiction that $(0, 1)$ is countable. Then we can list all elements:

$$r_1 = 0.d_{11}d_{12}d_{13}\ldots$$

$$r_2 = 0.d_{21}d_{22}d_{23}\ldots$$

$$r_3 = 0.d_{31}d_{32}d_{33}\ldots$$

where $d_{ij}$ denotes the $j$-th decimal digit of $r_i$.

**Cantor's diagonal argument**: Construct $s = 0.s_1 s_2 s_3 \ldots$ where

$$s_n = \begin{cases} 3 & \text{if } d_{nn} \neq 3, \\ 7 & \text{if } d_{nn} = 3. \end{cases}$$

Then $s \in (0, 1)$ (since all digits are $3$ or $7$, avoiding issues with $0.999\ldots = 1$), but $s \neq r_n$ for every $n$ because $s$ and $r_n$ differ in the $n$-th decimal digit. This contradicts the assumption that every element of $(0, 1)$ appears in the list.
</Proof>

<Example title="Uncountable sets">
10. $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable (since it contains the uncountable subset $(0,1)$).
11. The set $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ of irrational numbers is uncountable. If it were countable, then $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q} \cup (\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q})$ would be a countable union of countable sets, hence countable -- contradicting Cantor's theorem.
12. The power set $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountable and has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}$.
</Example>

## Cantor's Theorem

<Theorem title="Cantor's theorem" number="0.8">
For any set $A$, there is no surjection from $A$ onto $\mathcal{P}(A)$. In particular, $|A| < |\mathcal{P}(A)|$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
Suppose for contradiction that $f : A \to \mathcal{P}(A)$ is surjective. Define

$$B = \lbrace a \in A : a \notin f(a) \rbrace.$$

Since $B \subseteq A$, we have $B \in \mathcal{P}(A)$, so by surjectivity there exists $b \in A$ with $f(b) = B$.

Now ask: is $b \in B$?

- If $b \in B$, then by definition of $B$, $b \notin f(b) = B$. Contradiction.
- If $b \notin B$, then by definition of $B$, $b \in f(b) = B$. Contradiction.

Either case yields a contradiction, so no such surjection exists.
</Proof>

<Example title="Hierarchy of infinities">
13. Cantor's theorem produces an infinite hierarchy of cardinalities:

$$|\mathbb{N}| < |\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})| < |\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}))| < \cdots$$

Writing $\aleph_0 = |\mathbb{N}|$, we have $|\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})| = 2^{\aleph_0} = |\mathbb{R}|$. The **continuum hypothesis** asserts that there is no cardinality strictly between $\aleph_0$ and $2^{\aleph_0}$. Goedel and Cohen showed this is independent of the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC).
</Example>

## Cardinality Comparisons

<Definition title="Cardinality comparison" number="0.25">
For sets $A$ and $B$:

- $|A| \leq |B|$ if there exists an injection $f : A \to B$.
- $|A| = |B|$ if there exists a bijection $f : A \to B$.
- $|A| < |B|$ if $|A| \leq |B|$ and $|A| \neq |B|$.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Cantor--Bernstein--Schroeder" number="0.9">
If $|A| \leq |B|$ and $|B| \leq |A|$, then $|A| = |B|$.

That is, if there exist injections $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to A$, then there exists a bijection $h : A \to B$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Application of Cantor--Bernstein--Schroeder">
14. To show $|(0,1)| = |\mathbb{R}|$, we exhibit injections in both directions. The inclusion $(0,1) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an injection. The function $g : \mathbb{R} \to (0,1)$ given by $g(x) = \frac{1}{\pi}\arctan(x) + \frac{1}{2}$ is also an injection (in fact a bijection). By Cantor--Bernstein--Schroeder, $|(0,1)| = |\mathbb{R}|$.
</Example>

## Significance for Analysis

<Example title="Countability in analysis">
15. The set of discontinuities of a monotone function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is countable. This is because each discontinuity corresponds to a jump, and we can assign to each jump a distinct rational number in the gap, giving an injection into $\mathbb{Q}$.
16. A countable set has **Lebesgue measure zero**: it can be covered by intervals of arbitrarily small total length. In particular, $\mathbb{Q}$ has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}$, while the irrationals have full measure. This is foundational for integration theory.
</Example>

<Remark>
The countable/uncountable distinction pervades analysis:

1. $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable and dense in $\mathbb{R}$, yet has measure zero. The irrationals $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ are uncountable and also dense, with full measure.
2. Countable sets are "small" in the sense of measure theory -- they cannot support a nontrivial measure.
3. The **Baire category theorem** provides another notion of "smallness" (meager sets), which is related but distinct from measure zero.
4. Cantor's diagonal argument reappears throughout analysis and logic: in the proof that $\ell^\infty$ is not separable, in Goedel's incompleteness theorems, and in the undecidability of the halting problem.

Understanding cardinality is thus not merely a set-theoretic curiosity but an essential analytical tool.
</Remark>
