# 논리와 명제 (Logic and Propositions)

Mathematical analysis rests on rigorous logical reasoning. Before we can state or prove any theorem about limits, continuity, or integration, we need a precise language for making and combining mathematical statements. This section develops that language.

## Propositions

<Definition title="Proposition" number="0.1">
A **proposition** (or **statement**) is a declarative sentence that is either true (T) or false (F), but not both. We typically denote propositions by letters $P$, $Q$, $R$, etc.
</Definition>

<Example title="Propositions and non-propositions">
1. "$2 + 3 = 5$" is a proposition (true).
2. "$7$ is even" is a proposition (false).
3. "$\pi > 3$" is a proposition (true).
4. "Is $5$ prime?" is **not** a proposition (it is a question).
5. "$x^2 = 4$" is **not** a proposition as stated (its truth value depends on $x$; it becomes a proposition once $x$ is specified or quantified).
</Example>

---

## Logical Connectives

<Definition title="Logical connectives" number="0.2">
Given propositions $P$ and $Q$, we form new propositions using the following **logical connectives**:

- **Negation**: $\neg P$ ("not $P$") is true when $P$ is false, and false when $P$ is true.
- **Conjunction**: $P \land Q$ ("$P$ and $Q$") is true when both $P$ and $Q$ are true.
- **Disjunction**: $P \lor Q$ ("$P$ or $Q$") is true when at least one of $P$ or $Q$ is true (inclusive or).
- **Implication**: $P \Rightarrow Q$ ("if $P$, then $Q$" or "$P$ implies $Q$") is false only when $P$ is true and $Q$ is false.
- **Biconditional**: $P \Leftrightarrow Q$ ("$P$ if and only if $Q$") is true when $P$ and $Q$ have the same truth value.
</Definition>

<Example title="Conjunction and disjunction">
6. Let $P$: "$6$ is divisible by $2$" (true) and $Q$: "$6$ is divisible by $3$" (true). Then $P \land Q$ is true: "$6$ is divisible by both $2$ and $3$."
7. Let $P$: "$5 > 7$" (false) and $Q$: "$5$ is prime" (true). Then $P \lor Q$ is true (since $Q$ is true), but $P \land Q$ is false (since $P$ is false).
</Example>

## Truth Tables

The truth values of compound propositions are determined by truth tables:

$$
\begin{array}{cc|ccccc}
P & Q & \neg P & P \land Q & P \lor Q & P \Rightarrow Q & P \Leftrightarrow Q \\
\hline
T & T & F & T & T & T & T \\
T & F & F & F & T & F & F \\
F & T & T & F & T & T & F \\
F & F & T & F & F & T & T
\end{array}
$$

<Example title="Implication with a false hypothesis">
8. The statement "If $1 = 2$, then pigs can fly" is a **true** implication. When the hypothesis $P$ is false, $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true regardless of $Q$. This is called a **vacuously true** statement. Vacuous truth appears throughout analysis: for instance, "every element of the empty set is positive" is vacuously true.
</Example>

<Remark>
The implication $P \Rightarrow Q$ is logically equivalent to $\neg P \lor Q$. This can be verified from the truth table. The contrapositive $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$ is also logically equivalent to $P \Rightarrow Q$, and is often easier to prove.
</Remark>

---

## Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse

<Definition title="Related conditionals" number="0.3">
Given an implication $P \Rightarrow Q$:

- The **converse** is $Q \Rightarrow P$.
- The **contrapositive** is $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$.
- The **inverse** is $\neg P \Rightarrow \neg Q$.

The original implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The converse and inverse are logically equivalent to each other, but **not** to the original.
</Definition>

<Example title="Contrapositive in analysis">
9. Consider: "If $(a_n)$ converges, then $(a_n)$ is bounded." The contrapositive is: "If $(a_n)$ is unbounded, then $(a_n)$ diverges." Both statements are equivalent and both are true. However, the converse "If $(a_n)$ is bounded, then $(a_n)$ converges" is **false** (consider $a_n = (-1)^n$).
</Example>

---

## Quantifiers

<Definition title="Quantifiers" number="0.4">
Let $P(x)$ be a predicate (a statement depending on a variable $x$ from a domain $D$):

- **Universal quantifier**: $\forall x \in D,\; P(x)$ means "$P(x)$ is true for every $x$ in $D$."
- **Existential quantifier**: $\exists x \in D,\; P(x)$ means "there exists at least one $x$ in $D$ for which $P(x)$ is true."
</Definition>

<Example title="Quantified statements">
10. $\forall n \in \mathbb{N},\; n + 1 > n$. This is true: every natural number is strictly less than its successor.
11. $\exists x \in \mathbb{R},\; x^2 = 2$. This is true: $x = \sqrt{2}$ works (assuming we are in $\mathbb{R}$).
12. $\forall x \in \mathbb{R},\; x^2 \geq 0$. This is true: the square of any real number is nonneg.
</Example>

<Remark>
The order of quantifiers matters enormously. Consider two statements about a sequence $(a_n)$:

- $\forall \varepsilon > 0,\; \exists N \in \mathbb{N},\; \forall n \geq N\colon |a_n - L| < \varepsilon$ (the sequence converges to $L$).
- $\exists N \in \mathbb{N},\; \forall \varepsilon > 0,\; \forall n \geq N\colon |a_n - L| < \varepsilon$ (eventually $a_n = L$ exactly).

The second statement is strictly stronger. Swapping $\forall$ and $\exists$ changes the meaning entirely.
</Remark>

---

## Negation of Quantified Statements

<Definition title="Negation of quantifiers" number="0.5">
The negation rules for quantifiers are:

$$\neg(\forall x \in D,\; P(x)) \;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\; \exists x \in D,\; \neg P(x)$$

$$\neg(\exists x \in D,\; P(x)) \;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\; \forall x \in D,\; \neg P(x)$$

In words: the negation of "for all" is "there exists ... not," and the negation of "there exists" is "for all ... not."
</Definition>

<Example title="Negating convergence">
13. The statement "$(a_n)$ converges to $L$" is:

$$\forall \varepsilon > 0,\; \exists N \in \mathbb{N},\; \forall n \geq N\colon |a_n - L| < \varepsilon.$$

Its negation, "$(a_n)$ does not converge to $L$," is:

$$\exists \varepsilon > 0,\; \forall N \in \mathbb{N},\; \exists n \geq N\colon |a_n - L| \geq \varepsilon.$$

Each $\forall$ becomes $\exists$ and vice versa, and the final inequality is negated. This mechanical procedure is essential for constructing proofs by contradiction in analysis.
</Example>

<Example title="Negating continuity">
14. The statement "$f$ is continuous at $c$" is:

$$\forall \varepsilon > 0,\; \exists \delta > 0,\; \forall x\colon |x - c| < \delta \Rightarrow |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon.$$

Its negation, "$f$ is **not** continuous at $c$," is:

$$\exists \varepsilon > 0,\; \forall \delta > 0,\; \exists x\colon |x - c| < \delta \;\land\; |f(x) - f(c)| \geq \varepsilon.$$

Note how $\Rightarrow$ became $\land$ under negation (since $\neg(P \Rightarrow Q) \Leftrightarrow P \land \neg Q$).
</Example>

## Logical Equivalences

<Definition title="Logical equivalence" number="0.6">
Two propositions $P$ and $Q$ are **logically equivalent**, written $P \equiv Q$, if they have the same truth value in every possible assignment of truth values to their components. Equivalently, $P \Leftrightarrow Q$ is a tautology.
</Definition>

Key logical equivalences used throughout analysis:

| Name | Equivalence |
|---|---|
| Double negation | $\neg(\neg P) \equiv P$ |
| De Morgan's laws | $\neg(P \land Q) \equiv \neg P \lor \neg Q$ |
| | $\neg(P \lor Q) \equiv \neg P \land \neg Q$ |
| Contrapositive | $(P \Rightarrow Q) \equiv (\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P)$ |
| Implication rewrite | $(P \Rightarrow Q) \equiv (\neg P \lor Q)$ |
| Biconditional | $(P \Leftrightarrow Q) \equiv (P \Rightarrow Q) \land (Q \Rightarrow P)$ |

<Example title="De Morgan's laws in analysis">
15. The statement "$(a_n)$ is bounded" means $\exists M > 0,\; \forall n\colon |a_n| \leq M$. Its negation is $\forall M > 0,\; \exists n\colon |a_n| > M$, which says the sequence is unbounded. De Morgan's laws underlie this quantifier-swapping process.
</Example>

---

## Unique Existence

<Definition title="Unique existence" number="0.7">
The notation $\exists! x \in D,\; P(x)$ means "there exists a **unique** $x$ in $D$ such that $P(x)$." Formally:

$$\exists x \in D,\; P(x) \;\;\land\;\; \forall y, z \in D,\; (P(y) \land P(z) \Rightarrow y = z).$$
</Definition>

<Example title="Unique existence of limits">
16. If a sequence $(a_n)$ converges, its limit is unique. That is, if $a_n \to L$ and $a_n \to L'$, then $L = L'$. This is proven by the triangle inequality: $|L - L'| \leq |L - a_n| + |a_n - L'| < 2\varepsilon$ for all $\varepsilon > 0$, forcing $L = L'$.
</Example>

---

## Summary

<Remark>
The logical framework developed here is indispensable for analysis. In particular:

1. **Implication and contrapositive** are the basis for direct and contrapositive proofs.
2. **Quantifier negation** is the key to proofs by contradiction: to show a $\forall$-statement is false, exhibit a single counterexample; to disprove an $\exists$-statement, show no witness exists.
3. **Nested quantifiers** appear in every fundamental definition of analysis ($\varepsilon$-$\delta$, $\varepsilon$-$N$, uniform continuity, uniform convergence).

Mastering these logical manipulations is a prerequisite for reading and writing rigorous proofs in analysis.
