# 실수의 비가산성 증명 (Uncountability of the Reals)

This page provides the full, rigorous proof that the real numbers are uncountable, using Cantor's diagonal argument. We also prove the more general Cantor's Theorem: for any set $S$, the power set $\mathcal{P}(S)$ has strictly greater cardinality than $S$.

## Part I: The Interval $(0, 1)$ is Uncountable

<Theorem title="Uncountability of (0,1)" number="0.3">
There is no surjection $f: \mathbb{N} \to (0, 1)$. Equivalently, the interval $(0, 1)$ is uncountable.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
We proceed by contradiction.

**Step 1: Assume a bijection exists.**

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $(0,1)$ is countable. Then there exists a surjection $f: \mathbb{N} \to (0,1)$. We can list all real numbers in $(0,1)$ as a sequence:

$$f(1) = r_1, \quad f(2) = r_2, \quad f(3) = r_3, \quad \ldots$$

with every element of $(0,1)$ appearing somewhere in this list.

**Step 2: Write each number in decimal expansion.**

Each $r_n$ has a decimal expansion $r_n = 0.d_{n,1}\, d_{n,2}\, d_{n,3}\, \ldots$ where each $d_{n,k} \in \lbrace 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9 \rbrace$. To ensure uniqueness, we choose the expansion that does **not** end in repeating $9$s (i.e., we use the terminating form when there is ambiguity, such as $0.5000\ldots$ rather than $0.4999\ldots$).

We can arrange all these expansions in an infinite table:

$$r_1 = 0.\mathbf{d_{1,1}}\, d_{1,2}\, d_{1,3}\, d_{1,4}\, \ldots$$
$$r_2 = 0.\, d_{2,1}\, \mathbf{d_{2,2}}\, d_{2,3}\, d_{2,4}\, \ldots$$
$$r_3 = 0.\, d_{3,1}\, d_{3,2}\, \mathbf{d_{3,3}}\, d_{3,4}\, \ldots$$
$$r_4 = 0.\, d_{4,1}\, d_{4,2}\, d_{4,3}\, \mathbf{d_{4,4}}\, \ldots$$
$$\vdots$$

The bold entries form the **diagonal**: $d_{1,1},\, d_{2,2},\, d_{3,3},\, d_{4,4},\, \ldots$

**Step 3: Construct a number not on the list.**

Define a new real number $d = 0.e_1\, e_2\, e_3\, \ldots$ where each digit $e_n$ is chosen as follows:

- $e_n = 2$ if $d_{n,n} \neq 2$
- $e_n = 3$ if $d_{n,n} = 2$

In other words, we look at the $n$-th diagonal digit $d_{n,n}$ and choose $e_n$ to be **different** from it. We specifically choose values $2$ and $3$ (avoiding $0$ and $9$) to ensure that $d$ does not end in repeating $0$s or $9$s, which would create ambiguity in the decimal representation.

**Step 4: Verify $d \in (0, 1)$.**

Since each $e_n \in \lbrace 2, 3 \rbrace$, we have $d \geq 0.222\ldots = 2/9 > 0$ and $d \leq 0.333\ldots = 1/3 < 1$. So $d \in (0, 1)$.

**Step 5: Show $d$ is not on the list.**

For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the number $d$ differs from $r_n$ in the $n$-th decimal place:

$$e_n \neq d_{n,n}$$

Since $d$ and $r_n$ differ in at least one decimal place (and neither representation ends in repeating $9$s), we have $d \neq r_n$.

Therefore $d \in (0, 1)$ but $d \neq r_n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, meaning $d$ is not in the range of $f$. This contradicts the assumption that $f$ is surjective.

**Step 6: Conclusion.**

The assumption that $(0,1)$ is countable leads to a contradiction. Therefore $(0,1)$ is uncountable.

Since $(0,1) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, this immediately implies $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable.
</Proof>

<Remark>
The key insight is the **diagonalization**: by choosing $e_n$ to differ from $d_{n,n}$, we ensure that the constructed number $d$ disagrees with the $n$-th listed number in the $n$-th position. No matter how cleverly we attempt to list the reals, this construction always produces a real number that escapes the list.

The choice of digits $2$ and $3$ (rather than, say, $0$ and $1$) is a technical detail that avoids the $0.999\ldots = 1.000\ldots$ ambiguity in decimal representations. Without this care, one might construct a number that equals some $r_n$ via a different decimal expansion.

## Part II: Cantor's Theorem ($|S| < |\mathcal{P}(S)|$)

<Theorem title="Cantor's Theorem" number="0.4">
For any set $S$ (finite or infinite), there is no surjection from $S$ onto $\mathcal{P}(S)$. Consequently, $|S| < |\mathcal{P}(S)|$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
We prove this in two steps.

**Step 1: There exists an injection $S \hookrightarrow \mathcal{P}(S)$.**

Define $\iota: S \to \mathcal{P}(S)$ by $\iota(x) = \lbrace x \rbrace$. This is clearly injective: if $\lbrace x \rbrace = \lbrace y \rbrace$, then $x = y$. So $|S| \leq |\mathcal{P}(S)|$.

**Step 2: There is no surjection $S \to \mathcal{P}(S)$.**

Suppose, for contradiction, that $g: S \to \mathcal{P}(S)$ is surjective. Define the **diagonal set**:

$$D = \lbrace x \in S : x \notin g(x) \rbrace$$

Since $D \subseteq S$, we have $D \in \mathcal{P}(S)$. Because $g$ is assumed surjective, there exists some $a \in S$ with $g(a) = D$.

Now we ask: is $a \in D$?

- **Case 1**: $a \in D$. By definition of $D$, this means $a \notin g(a)$. But $g(a) = D$, so $a \notin D$. Contradiction.

- **Case 2**: $a \notin D$. By definition of $D$, this means $a \in g(a)$. But $g(a) = D$, so $a \in D$. Contradiction.

Both cases lead to a contradiction, so no such surjection $g$ can exist.

**Conclusion**: Since there is an injection $S \hookrightarrow \mathcal{P}(S)$ but no surjection $S \to \mathcal{P}(S)$, we conclude $|S| < |\mathcal{P}(S)|$ (by the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroder theorem, or directly from the definition of strict inequality of cardinals).
</Proof>

<Remark>
The diagonal set $D = \lbrace x \in S : x \notin g(x) \rbrace$ is the abstract version of the diagonal argument. For each $x$, we look at whether $x$ is a member of $g(x)$ (the set assigned to $x$ by $g$), and we include $x$ in $D$ precisely when it is **not** in $g(x)$. This ensures $D$ differs from every $g(x)$ at the "coordinate" $x$ itself.

This is structurally identical to the decimal diagonal argument: in both cases, we construct an object that differs from the $n$-th listed object at the $n$-th position.
</Remark>

## Why the Diagonal Argument Fails for $\mathbb{Q}$

<Remark>
A natural question: why can we not diagonalize over the rationals? The answer is that the constructed diagonal number $d = 0.e_1 e_2 e_3 \ldots$ is a real number, but it need not be rational. In fact, $d$ is almost certainly irrational (its decimal expansion is non-repeating by construction). So the argument shows that $d \notin \mathbb{Q}$ is missing from any list of rationals, but this is not a contradiction since we never claimed $\mathbb{Q}$ contains $d$.

The diagonal argument works for $\mathbb{R}$ precisely because $\mathbb{R}$ is **complete**: every decimal expansion corresponds to a real number. This is another manifestation of the completeness axiom.
</Remark>

## Detailed Verification: Key Technical Points

### Why avoid digits 0 and 9?

<Remark>
In the decimal system, some real numbers have two representations:

$$0.4999\ldots = 0.5000\ldots$$

If we used $e_n = 0$ when $d_{n,n} \neq 0$ (and $e_n = 1$ otherwise), the constructed number $d$ might end in repeating $0$s, and its "other" representation (ending in repeating $9$s) could match some $r_n$. By restricting to digits $2$ and $3$, the number $d$ has a unique decimal representation, and the argument is airtight.
</Remark>

### Extending to all of $\mathbb{R}$

<Remark>
Once we know $(0,1)$ is uncountable, uncountability of $\mathbb{R}$ follows immediately: if $\mathbb{R}$ were countable, then $(0,1) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ would be countable (a subset of a countable set is countable), contradicting the theorem.

Alternatively, the function $\tan: (-\pi/2, \pi/2) \to \mathbb{R}$ is a bijection, showing $|(-\pi/2, \pi/2)| = |\mathbb{R}|$. Since $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ has the same cardinality as $(0,1)$ (via a linear map), we get $|(0,1)| = |\mathbb{R}|$.
</Remark>

## Connection to the Power Set Proof

The two proofs are deeply connected. One can make the correspondence explicit:

Each real number in $(0,1)$ can be written in binary as $0.b_1 b_2 b_3 \ldots$ with $b_k \in \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace$. This binary expansion defines a subset of $\mathbb{N}$:

$$T = \lbrace k \in \mathbb{N} : b_k = 1 \rbrace \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$$

This gives a (nearly bijective) map $(0,1) \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. The diagonal argument for $(0,1)$ in binary is then literally the same as the diagonal argument for $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$: flipping the $n$-th bit of the $n$-th binary expansion is the same as toggling membership of $n$ in the $n$-th subset.

## Summary of the Proof Strategy

<Remark>
The diagonal argument is a **proof by contradiction** with the following universal structure:

1. Assume a complete enumeration exists.
2. Use the enumeration against itself: construct a new object by "diagonalizing" (differing from the $n$-th object at the $n$-th coordinate).
3. The new object must be in the set (by closure properties) but cannot be in the enumeration (by construction).
4. This contradiction shows the enumeration cannot exist.

This pattern recurs throughout mathematics:
- **Russell's Paradox**: the set $R = \lbrace x : x \notin x \rbrace$ is a diagonalization over all sets.
- **Godel's Incompleteness Theorem**: the Godel sentence "I am not provable" diagonalizes over all proofs.
- **The Halting Problem**: the machine that does the opposite of what machine $n$ does on input $n$ diagonalizes over all Turing machines.
- **Fixed-point theorems** (Lawvere): Cantor's theorem can be seen as a consequence of the non-existence of certain surjections, formalized categorically.
