# Heine-Borel Theorem

The Heine-Borel theorem characterizes compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$: they are precisely the closed and bounded sets. This is one of the most frequently used results in real analysis.

---

## Statement

<Theorem title="Heine-Borel theorem" number="9.11">
A subset $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is compact if and only if it is **closed** and **bounded**.
</Theorem>

<Remark>
This theorem is specific to $\mathbb{R}^n$ (and more generally to finite-dimensional normed spaces). It fails in infinite-dimensional spaces and in general metric spaces.
</Remark>

## Easy direction: compact implies closed and bounded

<Theorem title="Compact implies closed" number="9.12">
Every compact subset of a metric space is closed.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Proof sketch: compact implies closed">
Let $K$ be compact and $x \notin K$. For each $y \in K$, choose disjoint open sets $U_y \ni x$ and $V_y \ni y$. The $V_y$ cover $K$; extract a finite subcover $V_{y_1}, \ldots, V_{y_m}$. Then $U = U_{y_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{y_m}$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ disjoint from $K$. So $K^c$ is open.
</Example>

<Theorem title="Compact implies bounded" number="9.13">
Every compact subset of a metric space is bounded.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Proof sketch: compact implies bounded">
Fix $x_0 \in X$. The balls $B(x_0, n)$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ cover $X$, hence cover $K$. Extract a finite subcover: $K \subseteq B(x_0, N)$ for some $N$. So $K$ is bounded.
</Example>

## Hard direction: closed and bounded implies compact

<Example title="Why this direction is nontrivial">
The claim is: if $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is closed and bounded, then **every** open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover. This is a statement about all possible open covers (uncountably many possibilities), so it requires a real proof.

The proof uses the completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ in an essential way. See the [full proof](/analysis/ch09-metric-spaces/proofs/p01-heine-borel-proof).
</Example>

## Applications

<Example title="[a,b] is compact">
$[a,b]$ is closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R}$, hence compact by Heine-Borel. This justifies all theorems about continuous functions on $[a,b]$: the extreme value theorem, uniform continuity, and the Riemann integrability of continuous functions.
</Example>

<Example title="Closed disk in R²">
$\overline{B}(0, R) = \{(x,y) : x^2 + y^2 \leq R^2\}$ is closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R}^2$, hence compact. Any continuous function $f: \overline{B}(0,R) \to \mathbb{R}$ attains its maximum and minimum.
</Example>

<Example title="The n-sphere is compact">
$S^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \|x\| = 1\}$ is closed (preimage of the closed set $\{1\}$ under the continuous function $\|x\|$) and bounded ($\|x\| = 1 \leq 1$). By Heine-Borel, $S^n$ is compact.
</Example>

<Example title="Closed subsets of compact sets">
Any closed subset of $[0,1]$ is compact. For instance, the Cantor set $C \subseteq [0,1]$ is compact (closed subset of a compact set).

If $f: K \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and $K$ is compact, then $f^{-1}(\{0\})$ is a closed subset of $K$, hence compact.
</Example>

## Non-examples: why both conditions are needed

<Example title="Bounded but not closed: not compact">
$(0, 1)$ is bounded but not closed. The open cover $\{(1/n, 1) : n \geq 2\}$ has no finite subcover. Not compact.
</Example>

<Example title="Closed but not bounded: not compact">
$\mathbb{R}$ is closed but not bounded. $\{(-n, n) : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ has no finite subcover. Not compact.

$\{n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is closed but not bounded. The sequence $x_n = n$ has no convergent subsequence. Not compact.
</Example>

<Example title="Neither closed nor bounded: not compact">
$\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]$ is bounded but not closed. Not compact.
</Example>

---

## Failure in infinite dimensions

<Example title="Closed unit ball in l² is not compact">
$B = \{x \in \ell^2 : \|x\| \leq 1\}$ is closed and bounded in $\ell^2$, but not compact: the sequence $e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots$ has no convergent subsequence (since $\|e_m - e_n\| = \sqrt{2}$ for $m \neq n$).

Heine-Borel fails because $\ell^2$ is infinite-dimensional. In infinite-dimensional normed spaces, the closed unit ball is never compact.
</Example>

<Example title="Compact subsets of l²">
By the general theorem, compact subsets of $\ell^2$ must be closed, bounded, AND have the property that coordinates decay uniformly: for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that $\sum_{n>N} x_n^2 < \varepsilon$ for all $x \in K$.

For instance, $K = \{x \in \ell^2 : |x_n| \leq 1/n\}$ is compact in $\ell^2$ (it is closed, bounded, and the tail condition is satisfied).
</Example>

---

## Equivalent formulations

<Theorem title="Characterizations of compactness in R^n" number="9.14">
For $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, the following are equivalent:

1. $K$ is compact (every open cover has a finite subcover).
2. $K$ is sequentially compact (every sequence has a convergent subsequence with limit in $K$).
3. $K$ is closed and bounded (Heine-Borel).
4. $K$ is complete and totally bounded.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Using the most convenient characterization">
- To prove a set is compact: often easiest to check "closed and bounded" (criterion 3).
- To prove a property holds for all compact sets: often easiest to use the open cover definition (criterion 1).
- To extract convergent subsequences: use sequential compactness (criterion 2).
- To prove a set is NOT compact: find a sequence with no convergent subsequence in $K$, or find an open cover with no finite subcover.
</Example>

<Remark>
The Heine-Borel theorem is the foundation for much of real analysis on $\mathbb{R}^n$. It makes compactness easy to verify (just check closed and bounded) and connects the abstract topological notion to concrete metric properties. The [proof](/analysis/ch09-metric-spaces/proofs/p01-heine-borel-proof) illustrates a beautiful interplay between completeness, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, and the structure of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
