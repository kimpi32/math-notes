# Compactness

Compactness is perhaps the most important topological property in analysis. It is the correct generalization of "closed and bounded" from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to arbitrary metric spaces, and it guarantees that continuous functions attain their extrema.

## Open cover definition

<Definition title="Open cover and compactness" number="9.10">
An **open cover** of a set $K \subseteq X$ is a collection of open sets $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ whose union contains $K$: $K \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} U_\alpha$.

A **subcover** is a subcollection that still covers $K$. A **finite subcover** is a subcover with finitely many sets.

$K$ is **compact** if every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover.
</Definition>

<Example title="[0,1] is compact">
Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be any open cover of $[0,1]$. We prove it has a finite subcover by contradiction (or by the Heine-Borel theorem). The key is that $[0,1]$ is closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R}$.
</Example>

<Example title="(0,1) is not compact">
The open cover $\{(1/n, 1) : n = 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$ covers $(0,1)$ (for any $x \in (0,1)$, choose $n > 1/x$). But no finite subcollection covers $(0,1)$: if we take $\{(1/n_1, 1), \ldots, (1/n_k, 1)\}$ with $N = \max(n_1, \ldots, n_k)$, then points in $(0, 1/N)$ are not covered.
</Example>

<Example title="R is not compact">
$\{(-n, n) : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ covers $\mathbb{R}$ but has no finite subcover.
</Example>

<Example title="Finite sets are compact">
Any finite set $K = \{x_1, \ldots, x_m\}$ is compact: given any open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$, for each $x_i$ choose $U_{\alpha_i}$ containing $x_i$. Then $\{U_{\alpha_1}, \ldots, U_{\alpha_m}\}$ is a finite subcover.
</Example>

## Sequential compactness

<Definition title="Sequential compactness" number="9.11">
A set $K$ is **sequentially compact** if every sequence in $K$ has a subsequence that converges to a point in $K$.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Equivalence in metric spaces" number="9.4">
In a metric space, a set is compact if and only if it is sequentially compact.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Sequential compactness of [0,1]">
Any sequence $(x_n) \subseteq [0,1]$ is bounded, so by Bolzano-Weierstrass it has a convergent subsequence. The limit is in $[0,1]$ since $[0,1]$ is closed. So $[0,1]$ is sequentially compact, hence compact.
</Example>

<Example title="(0,1) is not sequentially compact">
$x_n = 1/n \in (0,1)$. Every subsequence converges to $0 \notin (0,1)$. So $(0,1)$ is not sequentially compact.
</Example>

## Properties of compact sets

<Theorem title="Compact subsets are closed and bounded" number="9.5">
If $K$ is a compact subset of a metric space $(X, d)$, then $K$ is closed and bounded.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Closed and bounded but not compact (in general)">
In $\ell^2$, let $K = \{e_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ where $e_n$ is the $n$th standard basis vector. Then $K$ is closed (no limit points) and bounded ($\|e_n\| = 1$), but not compact: $d(e_m, e_n) = \sqrt{2}$ for $m \neq n$, so no subsequence is Cauchy, hence no subsequence converges.

In $\mathbb{R}^n$, the Heine-Borel theorem says closed and bounded implies compact. This fails in infinite-dimensional spaces.
</Example>

<Theorem title="Compact sets and continuous functions" number="9.6">
Let $f: X \to Y$ be continuous and $K \subseteq X$ compact. Then:

1. $f(K)$ is compact (continuous image of compact is compact).
2. If $Y = \mathbb{R}$, then $f$ attains its maximum and minimum on $K$ (extreme value theorem).
3. $f$ is uniformly continuous on $K$.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Extreme value theorem in metric spaces">
$f: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ continuous. Since $[0,1]$ is compact, $f$ attains its max and min. This generalizes the extreme value theorem from $\mathbb{R}$.

$f: (0,1) \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) = 1/x$. The domain is not compact, and $f$ does not attain a maximum.
</Example>

<Example title="Uniform continuity on compact sets">
$f(x) = x^2$ on $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous but not uniformly continuous. However, on any compact set $[a,b]$, it is uniformly continuous.

$f(x) = \sin(1/x)$ on $(0,1]$ is continuous but not uniformly continuous. Adding the point $0$ to the domain (defining $f(0) = 0$) makes $f$ discontinuous, so $[0,1]$ does not help.
</Example>

## Total boundedness

<Definition title="Totally bounded" number="9.12">
A set $A \subseteq X$ is **totally bounded** if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, $A$ can be covered by finitely many open balls of radius $\varepsilon$: there exist $x_1, \ldots, x_N \in A$ with $A \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^N B(x_i, \varepsilon)$.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Compactness = completeness + total boundedness" number="9.7">
A metric space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.
</Theorem>

<Example title="Totally bounded sets">
- $[0,1]$ in $\mathbb{R}$: for any $\varepsilon$, cover with $\lceil 1/\varepsilon \rceil$ balls. Complete (closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$) and totally bounded, hence compact.

- $(0,1)$: totally bounded (same argument) but not complete ($1/n$ has no limit in $(0,1)$). Hence not compact.

- The unit ball in $\ell^2$: not totally bounded (the $e_n$ are distance $\sqrt{2}$ apart, so they cannot be covered by finitely many balls of radius $1$).
</Example>

## Compact metric spaces

<Example title="The Cantor set is compact">
The Cantor set $C \subseteq [0,1]$ is closed (intersection of closed sets) and bounded. By Heine-Borel, $C$ is compact. It is also uncountable, totally disconnected, and has measure zero.
</Example>

<Example title="Compactness in function spaces">
In $C[0,1]$ with the sup metric, the closed unit ball $\{f : \|f\|_\infty \leq 1\}$ is closed and bounded but **not** compact (by the same argument as $\ell^2$: take $f_n(x) = x^n$, no uniformly convergent subsequence).

The **Arzela-Ascoli theorem** characterizes compact subsets of $C[0,1]$: $K \subseteq C[0,1]$ is compact iff $K$ is closed, uniformly bounded, and equicontinuous.
</Example>

<Remark>
Compactness is the analytical substitute for finiteness. Many arguments that work for finite sets ("choose the maximum," "extract a convergent subsequence," "reduce to finitely many cases") generalize to compact sets. The [Heine-Borel theorem](/analysis/ch09-metric-spaces/theorems/t01-heine-borel) makes compactness concrete in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
</Remark>
