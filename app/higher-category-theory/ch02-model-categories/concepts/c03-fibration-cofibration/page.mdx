# Fibration and Cofibration

Fibrations and cofibrations are the two structural pillars of a model category, complementing the weak equivalences. Fibrations capture "good surjections" (maps with path-lifting properties), while cofibrations capture "good inclusions" (maps with extension properties). Together, they provide the lifting and factorization machinery that makes homotopy theory work.

## Lifting Properties

<Definition title="Lifting property" number="2.1">
A morphism $i: A \to B$ has the **left lifting property** (LLP) with respect to $p: X \to Y$, equivalently $p$ has the **right lifting property** (RLP) with respect to $i$, written $i \;\square\; p$, if every commutative square

$$A \xrightarrow{f} X$$
$$\downarrow^i \quad\quad\quad \downarrow^p$$
$$B \xrightarrow{g} Y$$

admits a diagonal lift $h: B \to X$ with $h \circ i = f$ and $p \circ h = g$.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Fibrations and cofibrations via lifting" number="2.2">
In a model category $\mathcal{M}$:
- **Fibrations** = morphisms with the RLP with respect to all trivial cofibrations.
- **Trivial fibrations** = morphisms with the RLP with respect to all cofibrations.
- **Cofibrations** = morphisms with the LLP with respect to all trivial fibrations.
- **Trivial cofibrations** = morphisms with the LLP with respect to all fibrations.

The model structure is determined by the weak equivalences and either the fibrations or the cofibrations (the other is determined by the lifting property).
</Definition>

## Fibrations

<Example id="serre-fibration" title="Serre fibrations in Top">
A continuous map $p: E \to B$ is a **Serre fibration** if it has the homotopy lifting property for all CW complexes. Equivalently, it has the RLP with respect to $D^n \times \{0\} \hookrightarrow D^n \times [0,1]$ for all $n \geq 0$.

Examples:
- Fiber bundles are Serre fibrations.
- Covering maps are Serre fibrations.
- The projection $E \times F \to E$ is a (trivial) Serre fibration.
- The path fibration $PX \to X$ (evaluating a path at its endpoint) is a Serre fibration with fiber $\Omega X$.
</Example>

<Example id="kan-fibration" title="Kan fibrations in sSet">
A map $p: X \to Y$ of simplicial sets is a **Kan fibration** if it has the RLP with respect to all horn inclusions $\Lambda^n_k \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ for $n \geq 1$, $0 \leq k \leq n$.

When $Y = \Delta[0]$, a Kan fibration $X \to \Delta[0]$ means $X$ is a Kan complex. In general, Kan fibrations are "families of Kan complexes parametrized by $Y$" (the fibers are Kan complexes).

The geometric realization of a Kan fibration (with countable base) is a Serre fibration.
</Example>

<Example id="fibration-chain" title="Fibrations in chain complexes">
In $\mathbf{Ch}_{\geq 0}(R)$ with the projective model structure, a chain map $f: C \to D$ is a fibration if $f_n: C_n \to D_n$ is surjective for all $n \geq 1$.

The fibration condition does not require surjectivity in degree $0$. A trivial fibration is a surjective quasi-isomorphism (surjective in all degrees, including $0$, and inducing isomorphisms on homology).
</Example>

---

## Cofibrations

<Example id="cofibration-top" title="Cofibrations in Top">
In the Quillen model structure on $\mathbf{Top}$, cofibrations are retracts of relative CW inclusions: maps $i: A \to X$ where $X$ is obtained from $A$ by attaching cells.

Cofibrant objects are retracts of CW complexes. Since every space is fibrant, the bifibrant objects are exactly the CW complexes (up to retract).

The cofibration $S^{n-1} \hookrightarrow D^n$ (including the boundary sphere into the disk) is a generating cofibration: all cofibrations are built from these by pushout, transfinite composition, and retract.
</Example>

<Example id="cofibration-sset" title="Cofibrations in sSet">
In the Kan--Quillen model structure on $\mathbf{sSet}$, cofibrations are **monomorphisms** (levelwise injective maps). Since every simplicial set is a colimit of $\Delta[n]$'s and the boundary inclusions $\partial\Delta[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ generate all monomorphisms, these are the generating cofibrations.

Every simplicial set is cofibrant (the map $\emptyset \hookrightarrow X$ is always a monomorphism). This is one of the main technical advantages of working in $\mathbf{sSet}$.
</Example>

<Example id="cofibration-chain" title="Cofibrations in chain complexes">
In $\mathbf{Ch}_{\geq 0}(R)$ with the projective model structure, cofibrations are monomorphisms with levelwise projective cokernel. The generating cofibrations are the maps $0 \to D^n$ (the disk chain complex: $R$ in degrees $n$ and $n-1$, with identity differential) and $S^{n-1} \hookrightarrow D^n$ (the sphere to disk inclusion).

Cofibrant chain complexes are complexes of projective modules.
</Example>

## Generating Sets

<Definition title="Cofibrantly generated model category" number="2.3">
A model category $\mathcal{M}$ is **cofibrantly generated** if there exist sets (not proper classes) $I$ and $J$ of morphisms such that:
- $I$ is a set of **generating cofibrations**: the cofibrations are exactly the maps with the LLP with respect to maps having the RLP with respect to $I$.
- $J$ is a set of **generating trivial cofibrations**: similarly for trivial cofibrations.

Both $I$ and $J$ must satisfy the **small object argument** condition: the domains are small relative to $I$-cell (resp. $J$-cell) complexes.
</Definition>

<Example id="generating-sets-sset" title="Generating sets for sSet">
The Kan--Quillen model structure on $\mathbf{sSet}$ is cofibrantly generated:
- $I = \{\partial\Delta[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n] : n \geq 0\}$ (generating cofibrations).
- $J = \{\Lambda^n_k \hookrightarrow \Delta[n] : n \geq 1, 0 \leq k \leq n\}$ (generating trivial cofibrations).

The fibrations are maps with RLP against $J$ (Kan fibrations), and the trivial fibrations are maps with RLP against $I$ (maps surjective on all simplices).
</Example>

<Example id="generating-sets-top" title="Generating sets for Top">
The Quillen model structure on $\mathbf{Top}$ is cofibrantly generated:
- $I = \{S^{n-1} \hookrightarrow D^n : n \geq 0\}$ (boundary sphere inclusions).
- $J = \{D^n \times \{0\} \hookrightarrow D^n \times [0,1] : n \geq 0\}$ (cylinder inclusions).
</Example>

## Properties and Closure

<Example id="closure-cofibrations" title="Closure properties of cofibrations">
Cofibrations in any model category are closed under:
- **Composition**: if $i: A \to B$ and $j: B \to C$ are cofibrations, so is $j \circ i$.
- **Pushout**: if $i: A \to B$ is a cofibration and $f: A \to C$ is any map, then $C \to B \sqcup_A C$ is a cofibration.
- **Transfinite composition**: a transfinite composition of cofibrations is a cofibration.
- **Retract**: a retract of a cofibration is a cofibration.
- **Coproduct**: a coproduct of cofibrations is a cofibration.

The same closure properties hold for fibrations (with pullback replacing pushout, and limits replacing colimits).
</Example>

<Example id="pushout-cofibration" title="Pushout along cofibrations">
In $\mathbf{sSet}$, the pushout of $\partial\Delta[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ along a map $\partial\Delta[n] \to X$ produces $X$ with an $n$-cell attached:

$$X \hookrightarrow X \sqcup_{\partial\Delta[n]} \Delta[n]$$

This is a cofibration (since cofibrations are closed under pushout). Cell attachment is the basic building block for constructing CW-type objects in any cofibrantly generated model category.
</Example>

<Example id="pullback-fibration" title="Pullback of fibrations">
If $p: E \to B$ is a Kan fibration and $f: B' \to B$ is any map, the pullback $f^*(E) = E \times_B B' \to B'$ is again a Kan fibration. The fiber over a point $b' \in B'$ is the same as the fiber of $p$ over $f(b')$.

This is the simplicial analogue of pulling back a fiber bundle along a map.
</Example>

## The Small Object Argument

<Remark title="Small object argument">
The **small object argument** (due to Quillen) constructs factorizations from generating sets. Given a map $f: X \to Y$ and a set of generating cofibrations $I$, it produces a factorization $X \xrightarrow{i} Z \xrightarrow{p} Y$ where $i$ is a relative $I$-cell complex (built by iteratively attaching cells from $I$) and $p$ has the RLP with respect to $I$.

The construction is transfinite: at each step, all "obstructions" to lifting are killed by attaching cells. After sufficiently many (possibly transfinitely many) steps, the map $p$ has the desired lifting property.

This argument is the engine behind functorial factorization in cofibrantly generated model categories.
</Remark>

## Summary

<Remark title="Key points">
Fibrations and cofibrations provide the structural framework of model categories:

1. **Fibrations** have the RLP against trivial cofibrations; they are the "good surjections" with path-lifting properties.

2. **Cofibrations** have the LLP against trivial fibrations; they are the "good inclusions" with extension properties.

3. In $\mathbf{sSet}$: cofibrations = monomorphisms; fibrations = Kan fibrations. In $\mathbf{Top}$: cofibrations = relative CW inclusions; fibrations = Serre fibrations.

4. **Cofibrantly generated** model categories are specified by sets of generators, enabling the **small object argument** for constructing factorizations.

5. Both classes are closed under composition, (co)base change, transfinite composition, and retracts.
