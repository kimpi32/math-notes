# Geometric Realization

Geometric realization is the functor that turns a simplicial set into a topological space. It replaces each abstract $n$-simplex with a topological $n$-simplex $|\Delta^n|$ and glues them according to the face and degeneracy maps. Together with the singular simplicial set functor going the other way, geometric realization establishes a deep connection between combinatorial and topological homotopy theory.

## The Topological Simplex

<Definition title="Topological standard simplex" number="1.1">
The **topological standard $n$-simplex** is

$$|\Delta^n| = \left\{(t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \;\middle|\; t_i \geq 0, \sum_{i=0}^n t_i = 1\right\}.$$

For each order-preserving map $\varphi: [m] \to [n]$, there is an induced continuous map $|\varphi|: |\Delta^m| \to |\Delta^n|$ given by

$$|\varphi|(t_0, \ldots, t_m) = (s_0, \ldots, s_n), \quad s_j = \sum_{i \in \varphi^{-1}(j)} t_i.$$

This defines a covariant functor $|\cdot|: \Delta \to \mathbf{Top}$.
</Definition>

<Example id="low-dim-simplices" title="Low-dimensional topological simplices">
In low dimensions:
- $|\Delta^0| = \{1\}$: a single point.
- $|\Delta^1| = \{(t_0, t_1) : t_0 + t_1 = 1, t_i \geq 0\} \cong [0, 1]$: a line segment.
- $|\Delta^2|$: a filled triangle with vertices $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)$.
- $|\Delta^3|$: a solid tetrahedron.

The coface map $|\delta^i|: |\Delta^{n-1}| \to |\Delta^n|$ embeds the $(n-1)$-simplex as the $i$-th face (the face opposite vertex $i$). The codegeneracy $|\sigma^j|: |\Delta^{n+1}| \to |\Delta^n|$ collapses the edge from vertex $j$ to vertex $j+1$.
</Example>

## Definition of Geometric Realization

<Definition title="Geometric realization" number="1.2">
The **geometric realization** of a simplicial set $X$ is the topological space

$$|X| = \left(\coprod_{n \geq 0} X_n \times |\Delta^n|\right) / {\sim}$$

where $X_n$ is given the discrete topology and the equivalence relation $\sim$ is generated by:

$$(d_i(x), t) \sim (x, |\delta^i|(t)) \quad \text{for } x \in X_n, \; t \in |\Delta^{n-1}|$$
$$(s_j(x), t) \sim (x, |\sigma^j|(t)) \quad \text{for } x \in X_n, \; t \in |\Delta^{n+1}|$$

Equivalently, $|X|$ is the coend

$$|X| = \int^{[n] \in \Delta} X_n \times |\Delta^n| = X \otimes_\Delta |\cdot|$$

which is the tensor product of the functor $X: \Delta^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathbf{Set}$ with $|\cdot|: \Delta \to \mathbf{Top}$.
</Definition>

<Example id="realization-delta-n" title="Realization of standard simplices">
The geometric realization $|\Delta[n]|$ is homeomorphic to $|\Delta^n|$ (the topological $n$-simplex). This follows from the Yoneda lemma and the coend formula:

$$|\Delta[n]| = \int^{[m]} \operatorname{Hom}_\Delta([m], [n]) \times |\Delta^m| \cong |\Delta^n|.$$

The last isomorphism is the "co-Yoneda lemma" (or density theorem for coends).
</Example>

<Example id="realization-boundary" title="Realization of the boundary">
The geometric realization $|\partial\Delta[n]|$ is the boundary of the topological $n$-simplex, i.e., the union of all $(n-1)$-dimensional faces of $|\Delta^n|$. This is homeomorphic to the $(n-1)$-sphere $S^{n-1}$.

For $n = 2$: $|\partial\Delta[2]|$ is the boundary of a triangle, homeomorphic to $S^1$.
</Example>

<Example id="realization-circle" title="Realization of the simplicial circle">
The simplicial set $S^1 = \Delta[1]/\partial\Delta[1]$ has one vertex and one non-degenerate edge (with both endpoints identified). Its geometric realization $|S^1|$ is obtained by taking the interval $[0,1]$ and identifying $0 \sim 1$, giving the circle $S^1$.
</Example>

<Example id="realization-nerve-group" title="Classifying spaces via geometric realization">
For a group $G$, the geometric realization $|N(BG)|$ is the classifying space $BG$.

For $G = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$: $|N(B(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}))| \simeq L_n^\infty$, the infinite lens space, which has $\pi_1 = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and is a $K(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}, 1)$.

For $G = S_3$ (symmetric group on 3 elements): the classifying space $BS_3$ has $\pi_1 = S_3$ and all higher homotopy groups trivial.
</Example>

## Properties of Geometric Realization

<Theorem title="Geometric realization preserves finite products" number="1.3">
If $X$ and $Y$ are simplicial sets, then $|X \times Y| \cong |X| \times |Y|$ (where the right side uses the compactly generated product topology), provided at least one of $X$ or $Y$ is locally finite (finitely many non-degenerate simplices in each dimension).

Without the locally finite condition, one uses compactly generated spaces to ensure the product formula holds.
</Theorem>

<Example id="realization-product" title="Product of simplicial sets">
The product $\Delta[1] \times \Delta[1]$ is a simplicial set whose geometric realization is the square $[0,1]^2$. This square is triangulated: the non-degenerate $2$-simplices correspond to the two triangles in the standard triangulation of the square (upper-left and lower-right).

The Eilenberg--Zilber theorem provides a natural quasi-isomorphism between $C_*(X \times Y)$ and $C_*(X) \otimes C_*(Y)$ at the chain level.
</Example>

<Example id="realization-coproduct" title="Realization preserves coproducts">
Geometric realization preserves all colimits (since it is a left adjoint). In particular:

$$|X \sqcup Y| = |X| \sqcup |Y|$$

and more generally, if $X = \operatorname{colim}_i X_i$, then $|X| = \operatorname{colim}_i |X_i|$.

This means $|X|$ is built by gluing together the geometric realizations of the standard simplices appearing in $X$.
</Example>

## The Singular Simplicial Set

<Definition title="Singular simplicial set" number="1.4">
The **singular simplicial set** (or **singular complex**) of a topological space $Y$ is the simplicial set $\operatorname{Sing}(Y)$ defined by

$$\operatorname{Sing}(Y)_n = \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Top}}(|\Delta^n|, Y) = \{\text{continuous maps } |\Delta^n| \to Y\}.$$

Face maps $d_i$ and degeneracy maps $s_j$ are induced by precomposition with the coface maps $|\delta^i|$ and codegeneracy maps $|\sigma^j|$.

This defines a functor $\operatorname{Sing}: \mathbf{Top} \to \mathbf{sSet}$.
</Definition>

<Example id="sing-point" title="Singular set of a point">
$\operatorname{Sing}(*)_n$ is a single element for each $n$ (the unique map $|\Delta^n| \to *$). So $\operatorname{Sing}(*) = \Delta[0]$, the terminal simplicial set.
</Example>

<Example id="sing-interval" title="Singular set of the interval">
$\operatorname{Sing}([0,1])$ is an "enormous" simplicial set: its $1$-simplices are all continuous paths $[0,1] \to [0,1]$, its $2$-simplices are all continuous maps from a triangle into $[0,1]$, etc. Despite being large, it is a Kan complex (every horn can be filled) and is weakly equivalent to a point (since $[0,1]$ is contractible).
</Example>

<Example id="sing-circle" title="Singular set of the circle">
$\operatorname{Sing}(S^1)$ is a Kan complex with $\pi_1 = \mathbb{Z}$ and $\pi_n = 0$ for $n \geq 2$. It has uncountably many $1$-simplices (all loops and paths in $S^1$), but its homotopy type is completely described by $\pi_1 = \mathbb{Z}$.
</Example>

## The Adjunction

<Theorem title="Geometric realization and singular set adjunction" number="1.5">
The geometric realization and singular simplicial set functors form an adjunction

$$|\cdot| \dashv \operatorname{Sing}: \mathbf{sSet} \rightleftarrows \mathbf{Top}$$

with geometric realization as the left adjoint. The unit and counit are:

- **Unit** $\eta_X: X \to \operatorname{Sing}(|X|)$: sends an $n$-simplex $x \in X_n$ to the corresponding continuous map $|\Delta^n| \to |X|$.
- **Counit** $\varepsilon_Y: |\operatorname{Sing}(Y)| \to Y$: sends a point $(f, t)$ (where $f: |\Delta^n| \to Y$ and $t \in |\Delta^n|$) to $f(t) \in Y$.
</Theorem>

<Example id="counit-is-weak-equiv" title="Counit is a weak equivalence">
For any topological space $Y$, the counit $\varepsilon_Y: |\operatorname{Sing}(Y)| \to Y$ is a **weak homotopy equivalence**: it induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups. This is a classical theorem in algebraic topology.

For CW complexes, this map is actually a homotopy equivalence (by Whitehead's theorem). For general spaces, $|\operatorname{Sing}(Y)|$ is a CW approximation of $Y$.

This means that from the perspective of homotopy theory, every topological space is "modeled" by a simplicial set.
</Example>

<Example id="unit-not-iso" title="The unit is generally not an isomorphism">
The unit $\eta_X: X \to \operatorname{Sing}(|X|)$ is generally not an isomorphism (or even a weak equivalence for arbitrary $X$). However, when $X$ is a Kan complex, $\eta_X$ is a weak equivalence.

For example, if $X = \Delta[1]$, then $\operatorname{Sing}(|\Delta[1]|) = \operatorname{Sing}([0,1])$, which has uncountably many $1$-simplices, while $\Delta[1]$ has only three (two degenerate, one non-degenerate).
</Example>

---

## CW Structure

<Remark title="CW structure of geometric realization">
The geometric realization $|X|$ of any simplicial set $X$ naturally has the structure of a CW complex. The cells are in bijection with the non-degenerate simplices of $X$: each non-degenerate $n$-simplex contributes an open $n$-cell.

The $n$-skeleton of the CW complex $|X|$ is precisely $|\mathrm{sk}_n(X)|$, the geometric realization of the $n$-skeleton of $X$.

The attaching maps are determined by the face operators. Specifically, a non-degenerate $n$-simplex $x$ contributes a cell attached via the map $\partial|\Delta^n| \to |\mathrm{sk}_{n-1}(X)|$ induced by the faces $d_0(x), \ldots, d_n(x)$.
</Remark>

## Summary

<Remark title="Key points">
The main ideas of geometric realization are:

1. **Geometric realization** $|X|$ turns a simplicial set into a topological space by replacing abstract simplices with topological simplices and gluing.

2. The **singular functor** $\operatorname{Sing}$ goes the other way, producing a simplicial set from a topological space.

3. These form an **adjunction** $|\cdot| \dashv \operatorname{Sing}$ that is the bridge between combinatorial and topological homotopy theory.

4. The counit $|\operatorname{Sing}(Y)| \to Y$ is always a **weak homotopy equivalence**, showing that simplicial sets capture the homotopy theory of spaces.

5. Geometric realization $|X|$ is naturally a **CW complex**, with cells corresponding to non-degenerate simplices.
