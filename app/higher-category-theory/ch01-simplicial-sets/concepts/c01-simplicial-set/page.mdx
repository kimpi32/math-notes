# Simplicial Set

A simplicial set is a combinatorial model for topological spaces. It consists of sets of simplices in each dimension, connected by face and degeneracy maps satisfying the simplicial identities. Simplicial sets form the foundation for higher category theory: nerves of categories, Kan complexes (modeling spaces), and quasi-categories (modeling $\infty$-categories) are all special types of simplicial sets.

## The Simplex Category

<Definition title="Simplex category" number="1.1">
The **simplex category** $\Delta$ is the category whose objects are the finite nonempty totally ordered sets

$$[n] = \{0 < 1 < \cdots < n\}, \quad n \geq 0$$

and whose morphisms are the order-preserving (weakly monotone) maps $\varphi: [m] \to [n]$.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Coface and codegeneracy maps" number="1.2">
The morphisms of $\Delta$ are generated by two families of maps:

**Coface maps** $\delta^i: [n-1] \to [n]$ for $0 \leq i \leq n$: the unique injective order-preserving map whose image misses $i$.

**Codegeneracy maps** $\sigma^j: [n+1] \to [n]$ for $0 \leq j \leq n$: the unique surjective order-preserving map that hits $j$ twice.

These satisfy the **cosimplicial identities**:

$$\delta^j \delta^i = \delta^i \delta^{j-1} \quad (i < j)$$
$$\sigma^j \sigma^i = \sigma^i \sigma^{j+1} \quad (i \leq j)$$
$$\sigma^j \delta^i = \delta^i \sigma^{j-1} \quad (i < j)$$
$$\sigma^j \delta^j = \sigma^j \delta^{j+1} = \mathrm{id}$$
$$\sigma^j \delta^i = \delta^{i-1} \sigma^j \quad (i > j + 1)$$
</Definition>

<Example id="low-dim-delta" title="Low-dimensional morphisms in Delta">
In small dimensions:

- $\delta^0, \delta^1: [0] \to [1]$ are the two inclusions: $\delta^0(0) = 1$ and $\delta^1(0) = 0$.
- $\sigma^0: [1] \to [0]$ is the unique map.
- $\delta^0, \delta^1, \delta^2: [1] \to [2]$: for instance, $\delta^1$ maps $0 \mapsto 0, 1 \mapsto 2$, skipping $1$.
- There are $\binom{m+n}{n}$ morphisms $[m] \to [n]$ in total: these correspond to choosing which elements of $[n]$ lie in the image (with multiplicities).

The number of morphisms $[m] \to [n]$ equals $\binom{m+n}{n}$ because each order-preserving map $[m] \to [n]$ is determined by a weakly increasing sequence of $m+1$ elements from $[n]$.
</Example>

## Simplicial Sets

<Definition title="Simplicial set" number="1.3">
A **simplicial set** is a functor $X: \Delta^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathbf{Set}$. Equivalently, it is a presheaf on $\Delta$. The category of simplicial sets is denoted $\mathbf{sSet} = \mathbf{Fun}(\Delta^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Set})$.

Concretely, a simplicial set $X$ consists of:
- A set $X_n$ (called the set of **$n$-simplices**) for each $n \geq 0$;
- **Face maps** $d_i: X_n \to X_{n-1}$ for $0 \leq i \leq n$, induced by $\delta^i$;
- **Degeneracy maps** $s_j: X_n \to X_{n+1}$ for $0 \leq j \leq n$, induced by $\sigma^j$;

satisfying the **simplicial identities**:

$$d_i d_j = d_{j-1} d_i \quad (i < j)$$
$$s_i s_j = s_{j+1} s_i \quad (i \leq j)$$
$$d_i s_j = s_{j-1} d_i \quad (i < j)$$
$$d_j s_j = d_{j+1} s_j = \mathrm{id}$$
$$d_i s_j = d_{i-1} s_j \quad (i > j+1)$$
</Definition>

<Example id="standard-simplex" title="Standard simplex Delta[n]">
The **standard $n$-simplex** is the representable presheaf

$$\Delta[n] = \operatorname{Hom}_\Delta(-, [n]): \Delta^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathbf{Set}.$$

Its $m$-simplices are $\Delta[n]_m = \operatorname{Hom}_\Delta([m], [n])$, the set of order-preserving maps $[m] \to [n]$. By Yoneda, morphisms $\Delta[n] \to X$ in $\mathbf{sSet}$ correspond bijectively to $n$-simplices of $X$.

For $n = 0$: $\Delta[0]$ is a single point.
For $n = 1$: $\Delta[1]$ has two $0$-simplices (vertices), one non-degenerate $1$-simplex (the edge), and all higher simplices are degenerate.
For $n = 2$: $\Delta[2]$ is a "filled triangle" with three vertices, three edges, and one non-degenerate $2$-simplex.
</Example>

<Example id="boundary-simplex" title="Boundary of the standard simplex">
The **boundary** $\partial\Delta[n]$ is the simplicial subset of $\Delta[n]$ consisting of all non-surjective maps $[m] \to [n]$. In other words, it contains all simplices of $\Delta[n]$ except the unique non-degenerate $n$-simplex $\mathrm{id}: [n] \to [n]$ and its degeneracies that require this top simplex.

For $n = 1$: $\partial\Delta[1]$ consists of just the two vertices, with no edge connecting them.
For $n = 2$: $\partial\Delta[2]$ is the boundary of a triangle (three edges and three vertices, but no interior face).

The inclusion $\partial\Delta[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ is a fundamental cofibration in the theory of simplicial sets.
</Example>

<Example id="simplicial-circle" title="The simplicial circle">
The **simplicial circle** $S^1$ can be modeled as the quotient $\Delta[1]/\partial\Delta[1]$, identifying the two vertices of the interval. Explicitly, $S^1$ has one $0$-simplex $v$, one non-degenerate $1$-simplex $\sigma$ with $d_0(\sigma) = d_1(\sigma) = v$, and all higher simplices are degenerate.

The geometric realization $|S^1|$ is homeomorphic to the topological circle.
</Example>

## Degenerate and Non-degenerate Simplices

<Definition title="Degenerate simplex" number="1.4">
An $n$-simplex $x \in X_n$ is **degenerate** if $x = s_j(y)$ for some $y \in X_{n-1}$ and some $0 \leq j \leq n-1$. An $n$-simplex is **non-degenerate** if it is not degenerate.

Every simplex $x \in X_n$ can be written uniquely as $x = s_{j_k} \cdots s_{j_1}(y)$ where $y$ is non-degenerate and $j_1 < j_2 < \cdots < j_k$. This is the **Eilenberg--Zilber decomposition**.
</Definition>

<Example id="degenerate-delta2" title="Degenerate simplices in Delta[2]">
Consider $\Delta[2]$. Its non-degenerate simplices are:
- Three $0$-simplices: $e_0, e_1, e_2$ (the constant maps to $0, 1, 2$)
- Three $1$-simplices: $d^{01}, d^{02}, d^{12}$ (the three edge inclusions)
- One $2$-simplex: $\mathrm{id}_{[2]}$

All other simplices are degenerate. For instance, $s_0(e_0) \in \Delta[2]_1$ is the degenerate edge at vertex $0$.

The total number of $m$-simplices in $\Delta[n]$ is $\binom{m+n}{n}$, but only $\binom{n+1}{m+1}$ of these are non-degenerate (for $m \leq n$).
</Example>

## Basic Constructions

<Example id="discrete-simplicial-set" title="Discrete simplicial sets">
For any set $S$, the **discrete (or constant) simplicial set** has $X_n = S$ for all $n$, with all face and degeneracy maps being the identity. This defines a fully faithful functor $\mathbf{Set} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{sSet}$.

Geometrically, a discrete simplicial set is a collection of points with no higher-dimensional simplices.
</Example>

<Example id="simplicial-set-product" title="Products of simplicial sets">
The product $X \times Y$ of simplicial sets is defined levelwise:

$$(X \times Y)_n = X_n \times Y_n$$

with face and degeneracy maps applied componentwise: $d_i(x, y) = (d_i x, d_i y)$, $s_j(x, y) = (s_j x, s_j y)$.

The product $\Delta[1] \times \Delta[1]$ models a square. It has four $0$-simplices, and its geometric realization is a square (divided into triangles).
</Example>

<Example id="simplicial-set-coproduct" title="Coproducts (disjoint unions)">
The coproduct (disjoint union) is also levelwise: $(X \sqcup Y)_n = X_n \sqcup Y_n$.

Thus $\Delta[0] \sqcup \Delta[0]$ is a simplicial set with two $0$-simplices and no non-degenerate higher simplices: geometrically, two disjoint points.
</Example>

<Example id="simplicial-sphere" title="Simplicial spheres">
The **simplicial $n$-sphere** can be defined as $S^n = \Delta[n]/\partial\Delta[n]$ (the quotient collapsing the boundary to a point).

For $n = 0$: $S^0 = \Delta[0] \sqcup \Delta[0]$ (two points).
For $n = 1$: $S^1$ has one vertex and one non-degenerate $1$-simplex (a loop).
For $n = 2$: $S^2$ has one vertex, no non-degenerate edges, and one non-degenerate $2$-simplex.

The geometric realization $|S^n|$ is homeomorphic to the topological $n$-sphere.
</Example>

## The Yoneda Embedding and Representable Presheaves

<Remark title="Yoneda for simplicial sets">
The Yoneda lemma tells us that for any simplicial set $X$:

$$\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{sSet}}(\Delta[n], X) \cong X_n.$$

This means an $n$-simplex of $X$ is the same thing as a map $\Delta[n] \to X$. Face and degeneracy operations correspond to precomposition with the coface and codegeneracy maps.

The category $\mathbf{sSet}$ is a presheaf category, so it is **complete, cocomplete**, and has internal hom objects (function complexes). This makes it an excellent combinatorial model for homotopy theory.
</Remark>

<Example id="simplex-colimit" title="Every simplicial set is a colimit of standard simplices">
Every simplicial set $X$ is canonically the colimit of its simplices:

$$X \cong \operatorname{colim}_{(\Delta[n] \to X) \in \Delta/X} \Delta[n]$$

where $\Delta/X$ is the category of simplices of $X$ (the comma category). This is a formal consequence of being a presheaf: every presheaf is a colimit of representables.

This decomposition is the simplicial analogue of the CW decomposition of a space into cells.
</Example>

## Simplicial Homotopy

<Definition title="Simplicial homotopy" number="1.5">
Let $f, g: X \to Y$ be maps of simplicial sets. A **simplicial homotopy** from $f$ to $g$ is a map $H: X \times \Delta[1] \to Y$ such that $H|_{X \times \{0\}} = f$ and $H|_{X \times \{1\}} = g$.

More precisely, identifying $X \times \{0\} \cong X$ with the map $\mathrm{id} \times d^1: X \times \Delta[0] \to X \times \Delta[1]$ (vertex $0$ is the target of $\delta^1$), we require $H \circ (\mathrm{id} \times d^1) = f$, and similarly for $g$.
</Definition>

<Example id="homotopy-constant" title="Homotopy to a constant map">
Let $X = \Delta[1]$ and $Y = \Delta[1]$. The identity map $\mathrm{id}: \Delta[1] \to \Delta[1]$ and the constant map at vertex $0$ are related by the simplicial homotopy $H: \Delta[1] \times \Delta[1] \to \Delta[1]$ defined by $(s, t) \mapsto \min(s, t)$ (in the order-preserving sense). This witnesses that $\Delta[1]$ is contractible.

More generally, $\Delta[n]$ is contractible for all $n$: there is a simplicial homotopy from $\mathrm{id}_{\Delta[n]}$ to the constant map at vertex $0$, given by $(x, t) \mapsto \min(x, t \cdot n)$ (appropriately formalized via the cone construction).
</Example>

## Skeleton and Coskeleton

<Definition title="Skeleton and coskeleton" number="1.6">
The **$n$-skeleton** $\mathrm{sk}_n(X)$ of a simplicial set $X$ is the simplicial set generated by the simplices of dimension $\leq n$. Formally, $\mathrm{sk}_n$ is the left Kan extension of the restriction $X|_{\Delta_{\leq n}}$ along the inclusion $\Delta_{\leq n} \hookrightarrow \Delta$.

The **$n$-coskeleton** $\mathrm{cosk}_n(X)$ is the right Kan extension. There is an adjunction $\mathrm{sk}_n \dashv \mathrm{cosk}_n$.

A simplicial set $X$ is **$n$-skeletal** if $X = \mathrm{sk}_n(X)$, meaning all simplices of dimension $> n$ are degenerate. It is **$n$-coskeletal** if $X = \mathrm{cosk}_n(X)$, meaning the $m$-simplices for $m > n$ are uniquely determined by the simplices of dimension $\leq n$.
</Definition>

<Example id="nerve-coskeletal" title="Nerves are 2-coskeletal">
The nerve of a category (discussed in the next section) is a $2$-coskeletal simplicial set. This means that a simplicial set is the nerve of a category if and only if its simplices of dimension $\leq 2$ satisfy the appropriate compatibility conditions and all higher simplices are uniquely determined.

Concretely, an $n$-simplex of a nerve $N(\mathcal{C})$ for $n \geq 2$ is a composable chain of $n$ morphisms, which is completely determined by its faces (the sub-chains of length $n-1$).
</Example>

## Summary

<Remark title="Key points">
The essential ideas about simplicial sets are:

1. A **simplicial set** is a functor $\Delta^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathbf{Set}$, specified by sets of simplices and face/degeneracy maps satisfying the simplicial identities.

2. The standard simplices $\Delta[n]$ are the building blocks; every simplicial set is a colimit of standard simplices.

3. The category $\mathbf{sSet}$ is a presheaf category, so it has all limits, colimits, and internal homs.

4. Simplicial sets provide a purely combinatorial foundation for homotopy theory, avoiding point-set topology entirely.

5. Three key special classes are: **nerves** of categories (encoding categorical structure), **Kan complexes** (encoding homotopy types), and **quasi-categories** (encoding $\infty$-categorical structure).
