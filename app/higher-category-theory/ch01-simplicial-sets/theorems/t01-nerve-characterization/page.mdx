# Characterization of Nerves

The nerve characterization theorem gives a precise criterion for when a simplicial set is the nerve of a category: it must satisfy the unique inner horn filling condition (equivalently, the Segal condition). This theorem is the foundation for the passage from combinatorial simplicial data to categorical structure, and its relaxation leads directly to the definition of quasi-categories.

## Statement

<Theorem title="Characterization of Nerves" number="1.1">
A simplicial set $X$ is isomorphic to the nerve of a (small) category if and only if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

**(a) Unique inner horn fillers.** For every $n \geq 2$ and $0 < k < n$, every map $\Lambda^n_k \to X$ extends to a **unique** map $\Delta[n] \to X$.

**(b) Segal condition.** For every $n \geq 2$, the Segal map

$$X_n \xrightarrow{\;\sim\;} X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1 \times_{X_0} \cdots \times_{X_0} X_1 \quad (n \text{ copies of } X_1)$$

induced by the spine inclusion $I[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ is a bijection.

**(c) 2-coskeletal with unique composition.** $X$ is $2$-coskeletal (all simplices of dimension $\geq 3$ are uniquely determined by their $2$-faces), and every pair of composable $1$-simplices has a unique composite $2$-simplex.
</Theorem>

---

## Proof Sketch

<Proof>
**(Nerve $\Rightarrow$ Unique inner horn fillers.)** Let $X = N(\mathcal{C})$. An inner horn $\Lambda^n_k \to N(\mathcal{C})$ for $0 < k < n$ specifies $n$ composable morphisms except for the morphisms involving the $k$-th vertex. Since $k$ is inner, the missing data is a composition $f_{k+1} \circ f_k$, which exists and is unique. The $2$-coskeletal property ensures the full $n$-simplex is uniquely determined.

**(Unique inner horn fillers $\Rightarrow$ Segal condition.)** The spine $I[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ factors through inner horns: $I[n] \hookrightarrow \Lambda^n_1 \hookrightarrow \Lambda^{n}_{\text{full}}$. Unique extension along each inner horn shows that $X_n \cong X_1 \times_{X_0} \cdots \times_{X_0} X_1$.

**(Segal condition $\Rightarrow$ Nerve.)** Define a category $\mathcal{C}$ with $\operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C}) = X_0$, $\operatorname{Mor}(\mathcal{C}) = X_1$, source $= d_1$, target $= d_0$, identity $= s_0$. The Segal condition gives a composition map: given composable $f, g \in X_1$, there is a unique $\sigma \in X_2$ with $d_2(\sigma) = f$ and $d_0(\sigma) = g$; define $g \circ f = d_1(\sigma)$.

Associativity follows from the Segal condition at level $3$: any composable triple $(f, g, h)$ determines a unique $3$-simplex, and examining its faces shows $(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)$. Identity axioms follow from the degeneracy relations. Then $X \cong N(\mathcal{C})$.
</Proof>

## Key Examples

<Example id="delta-n-nerve" title="Standard simplex as a nerve">
$\Delta[n] = N([n])$ is the nerve of the linear order category $[n] = (0 \to 1 \to \cdots \to n)$. The unique inner horn filling property is clear: in a linear order, any composable pair has a unique composite (the unique morphism between the endpoints).

The Segal map $\Delta[n]_m \to \Delta[n]_1 \times_{\Delta[n]_0} \cdots \times_{\Delta[n]_0} \Delta[n]_1$ is the bijection between order-preserving maps $[m] \to [n]$ and chains of $m$ composable morphisms in $[n]$.
</Example>

<Example id="non-nerve" title="The simplicial circle is not a nerve">
The simplicial circle $S^1 = \Delta[1]/\partial\Delta[1]$ has one vertex $v$, one non-degenerate edge $\sigma$ with $d_0(\sigma) = d_1(\sigma) = v$, and all higher simplices degenerate. Consider the inner horn $\Lambda^2_1 \to S^1$ with $d_0 = \sigma$ and $d_2 = \sigma$. A filler would need a $2$-simplex $\tau$ with $d_0(\tau) = \sigma$ and $d_2(\tau) = \sigma$. But the only $2$-simplices in $S^1$ are degenerate ones ($s_0(\sigma)$ and $s_1(\sigma)$), and neither satisfies both conditions simultaneously (since $d_0 s_0(\sigma) = \sigma$ but $d_2 s_0(\sigma) = s_0(v)$, which is degenerate).

So $S^1$ does not satisfy the inner horn filling property and is not a nerve of any category.
</Example>

<Example id="nerve-groupoid-char" title="Characterization of nerves of groupoids">
A simplicial set $X$ is the nerve of a groupoid if and only if every horn $\Lambda^n_k \to X$ (for all $n \geq 1$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$) has a **unique** filler. This adds the outer horns to the nerve characterization.

Unique outer horn fillers at level $2$ give: for any $g: c_1 \to c_2$ and $h: c_0 \to c_2$, there is a unique $f$ with $g \circ f = h$. Taking $h = \mathrm{id}_{c_1}$ gives $g \circ g^{-1} = \mathrm{id}$, showing $g$ is right-invertible. A dual argument with $\Lambda^2_2$ shows left-invertibility.
</Example>

<Example id="characterization-poset" title="Nerves of posets">
A simplicial set $X$ is the nerve of a poset if and only if it is the nerve of a category (unique inner horn fillers) and additionally has at most one $1$-simplex between any two $0$-simplices. Equivalently, the function $X_1 \to X_0 \times X_0$ given by $(d_1, d_0)$ is injective.

For instance, $N(\{0 < 1 < 2\})$ has exactly one edge from $i$ to $j$ when $i \leq j$ and none otherwise.
</Example>

<Example id="segal-maps-explicit" title="Segal maps in low dimensions">
The Segal map at level $2$ is:

$$X_2 \to X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1 = \{(f, g) \in X_1 \times X_1 : d_0(f) = d_1(g)\}$$

sending $\sigma \mapsto (d_2(\sigma), d_0(\sigma))$. This is a bijection iff every composable pair determines a unique $2$-simplex.

At level $3$, the Segal map is:

$$X_3 \to X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1 \times_{X_0} X_1$$

This uses the $3$ consecutive edges of a $3$-simplex. Bijectivity here encodes associativity of composition.
</Example>

## Connection to Higher Category Theory

<Example id="relaxation-to-qcat" title="Relaxation: from nerves to quasi-categories">
The nerve characterization theorem motivates the definition of quasi-categories:

- **Nerve of a category**: unique inner horn fillers (strict composition, strict associativity).
- **Quasi-category**: inner horn fillers exist but need not be unique (composition up to homotopy, associativity up to coherent homotopy).

The passage from "unique" to "existence" is the key weakening that leads from $1$-categories to $(\infty, 1)$-categories. All the coherence data (associativity, Mac Lane pentagon, etc.) is automatically encoded by the higher horn filling conditions.
</Example>

<Example id="2-nerve" title="Nerves of 2-categories">
The nerve characterization generalizes to higher categories. For $2$-categories, the **Duskin nerve** $N_D(\mathcal{C})$ is a simplicial set with unique inner horn fillers for $n \geq 4$, existence and uniqueness for $\Lambda^3_k$ (inner), and existence (but not uniqueness) for $\Lambda^2_1$. The non-uniqueness at level $2$ reflects the fact that $2$-categories have non-trivial $2$-morphisms between compositions.

More generally, the nerve of an $n$-category has unique inner horn fillers above dimension $n+1$.
</Example>

<Example id="segal-category" title="Segal categories">
A **Segal category** is a simplicial space $X: \Delta^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathbf{sSet}$ with $X_0$ discrete and the Segal maps

$$X_n \xrightarrow{\;\simeq\;} X_1 \times_{X_0}^h \cdots \times_{X_0}^h X_1$$

being weak equivalences (not bijections). This is another model for $(\infty, 1)$-categories, equivalent to quasi-categories by a Quillen equivalence. The Segal condition is thus the common thread linking all models of $\infty$-categories.
</Example>

## Adjunction with the Fundamental Category

<Theorem title="Nerve-fundamental category adjunction" number="1.2">
The nerve functor $N: \mathbf{Cat} \to \mathbf{sSet}$ has a left adjoint $\tau_1: \mathbf{sSet} \to \mathbf{Cat}$, called the **fundamental category** (or **homotopy category**) functor. For any simplicial set $X$:

$$\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Cat}}(\tau_1(X), \mathcal{C}) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{sSet}}(X, N(\mathcal{C})).$$

The category $\tau_1(X)$ has objects $X_0$, and morphisms are generated by $X_1$ modulo the relation imposed by $X_2$: if $\sigma \in X_2$ with $d_2(\sigma) = f$, $d_0(\sigma) = g$, then $d_1(\sigma) = g \circ f$ in $\tau_1(X)$.
</Theorem>

<Example id="fundamental-category-circle" title="Fundamental category of the circle">
For the simplicial circle $S^1$ (one vertex, one non-degenerate edge $\sigma$), the fundamental category $\tau_1(S^1)$ has one object and one generating morphism $\sigma$ with no relations (since there are no non-degenerate $2$-simplices beyond the degenerate ones). This gives the free monoid on one generator, which is $\mathbb{N}$.

Alternatively, using the fundamental groupoid $\tau_{\leq 1}(S^1)$ (which also identifies with $\tau_1$ for Kan complexes), we get $\pi_1(S^1) = \mathbb{Z}$.
</Example>

<Example id="fundamental-category-nerve" title="Round-trip: fundamental category of a nerve">
If $X = N(\mathcal{C})$, then $\tau_1(N(\mathcal{C})) \cong \mathcal{C}$. This is precisely the statement that the nerve is fully faithful: the left adjoint $\tau_1$ restricted to the essential image of $N$ is an inverse.

For a general simplicial set $X$, $\tau_1(X)$ computes the "best approximation" of $X$ by an ordinary category, discarding homotopy-theoretic information above dimension $1$.
</Example>

## Summary

<Remark title="Key points">
The nerve characterization theorem tells us:

1. A simplicial set is a nerve if and only if **inner horns fill uniquely** (equivalently, the Segal condition holds).

2. Adding **unique outer horn** fillers characterizes nerves of groupoids.

3. The nerve functor is **fully faithful** with a left adjoint (the fundamental category).

4. **Relaxing uniqueness** to mere existence gives the definition of quasi-categories, the central notion in higher category theory.

5. The Segal condition generalizes to **Segal spaces** and **Segal categories**, providing equivalent models for $\infty$-categories.
