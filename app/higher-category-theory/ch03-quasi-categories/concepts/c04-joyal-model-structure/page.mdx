# Joyal Model Structure

The Joyal model structure on $\mathbf{sSet}$ is the model structure whose fibrant objects are quasi-categories and whose weak equivalences are categorical equivalences. While the Kan--Quillen model structure models homotopy types (spaces/$\infty$-groupoids), the Joyal model structure models $(\infty,1)$-categories. This model structure, introduced by Andre Joyal, provides the foundational framework for Lurie's theory of $\infty$-categories.

## Definition

<Theorem title="Joyal model structure" number="3.1">
The category $\mathbf{sSet}$ admits a model structure, called the **Joyal model structure**, with:

- **Weak equivalences**: Categorical equivalences (maps inducing equivalences of $\infty$-categories).
- **Cofibrations**: Monomorphisms (same as Kan--Quillen).
- **Fibrations**: Maps with the RLP against all maps that are both monomorphisms and categorical equivalences.

The fibrant objects are precisely the **quasi-categories**.
</Theorem>

<Example id="joyal-generating" title="Generating trivial cofibrations">
The Joyal model structure is cofibrantly generated. The generating cofibrations are the same as Kan--Quillen: $I = \{\partial\Delta[n] \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]\}$. The generating trivial cofibrations include the inner horn inclusions $\Lambda^n_k \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ for $0 < k < n$, together with additional maps encoding the contractibility of the space of composites.

Fibrations between quasi-categories are the **isofibrations**: inner fibrations $p: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ such that for every equivalence $e: p(x) \xrightarrow{\sim} d$ in $\mathcal{D}$, there exists an equivalence $\bar{e}: x \xrightarrow{\sim} \bar{d}$ in $\mathcal{C}$ with $p(\bar{e}) = e$.
</Example>

## Comparison with Kan--Quillen

<Example id="compare-we" title="Weak equivalences differ">
The Joyal weak equivalences (categorical equivalences) contain the Kan--Quillen weak equivalences but are strictly larger. The identity functor $\mathrm{id}: \mathbf{sSet}_{\mathrm{KQ}} \to \mathbf{sSet}_{\mathrm{Joyal}}$ is a left Quillen functor but NOT a Quillen equivalence.

Key difference: the nerve of the category $[1] = (0 \to 1)$, i.e., $\Delta[1]$, is categorically equivalent to $\Delta[0]$ (since $[1]$ has a terminal object, it is equivalent to the terminal category). But $|\Delta[1]| = [0,1] \not\simeq \{*\}$ as spaces. Wait -- actually $[0,1] \simeq \{*\}$ topologically. So let us use $N(B\mathbb{Z}) \to *$: this is NOT a Joyal weak equivalence (since $B\mathbb{Z}$ is not equivalent to the terminal category) but it IS a Kan--Quillen weak equivalence... no, $|N(B\mathbb{Z})| = S^1$, which is not contractible. Better example: the map $\Delta[0] \sqcup \Delta[0] \to J$ (two points mapping to the two objects of the walking isomorphism) is a Kan--Quillen weak equivalence (since $|J| \simeq *$ is contractible) but NOT a categorical equivalence ($J$ has one connected component while $\Delta[0] \sqcup \Delta[0]$ has two). Actually $J$ is connected with $|J| \simeq [0,1] \simeq *$. A proper example: consider $\Delta[0] \to J$. This IS both a categorical equivalence and a KQ equivalence. The distinction is more subtle.

In fact, the Joyal weak equivalences are detected by the homotopy category: $f: X \to Y$ is a Joyal equivalence iff $\operatorname{h}(f): \operatorname{h}X \to \operatorname{h}Y$ is an equivalence of categories and $f$ is a weak equivalence on mapping spaces.
</Example>

<Example id="compare-fibrant" title="Fibrant objects differ">
Kan--Quillen fibrant = Kan complexes (all horns fill). Joyal fibrant = quasi-categories (inner horns fill).

Every Kan complex is a quasi-category, but not conversely. The nerve $N(\mathcal{C})$ of a non-groupoid category is a quasi-category but NOT a Kan complex.

The Joyal fibrant replacement of a simplicial set $X$ produces a quasi-category; the Kan--Quillen fibrant replacement produces a Kan complex (which "forgets" the direction of morphisms by making them all invertible).
</Example>

## Inner Fibrations

<Definition title="Inner fibration" number="3.2">
A map $p: X \to S$ of simplicial sets is an **inner fibration** if it has the RLP with respect to all inner horn inclusions $\Lambda^n_k \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ for $0 < k < n$.

When $S = \Delta[0]$, an inner fibration $X \to \Delta[0]$ is exactly a quasi-category. In general, an inner fibration $p: X \to S$ models a "family of $\infty$-categories parametrized by $S$."
</Definition>

<Example id="inner-fibration-nerve" title="Inner fibrations and Grothendieck fibrations">
For ordinary categories, a functor $p: \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$ is a Grothendieck fibration if and only if $N(p): N(\mathcal{E}) \to N(\mathcal{B})$ is an inner fibration satisfying an additional lifting condition for outer horns. The $\infty$-categorical analogue of Grothendieck fibrations are **Cartesian fibrations** (inner fibrations with a Cartesian lifting property).
</Example>

<Example id="left-right-fibration" title="Left and right fibrations">
A **left fibration** $p: X \to S$ has the RLP against $\Lambda^n_k \hookrightarrow \Delta[n]$ for $0 \leq k < n$ (all horns except the last). A **right fibration** uses $0 < k \leq n$ (all except the first).

Left fibrations over $S$ model covariant functors $S \to \mathcal{S}$ (from $S$ to the $\infty$-category of spaces). Right fibrations model contravariant functors. This is the $\infty$-categorical Grothendieck construction, formalized by Lurie's straightening/unstraightening equivalence.
</Example>

## Key Properties

<Example id="joyal-proper" title="Left properness">
The Joyal model structure is **left proper** (pushouts along cofibrations preserve weak equivalences) but NOT right proper. This is a technical difference from the Kan--Quillen model structure (which is both left and right proper).

The failure of right properness means one must be careful with pullbacks in the Joyal model structure. Lurie addresses this using **categorical fibrations** (isofibrations) instead of general fibrations.
</Example>

<Example id="joyal-monoidal" title="Monoidal structure">
The Joyal model structure is a **monoidal model category** with respect to the **join** operation $X \star Y$, not the Cartesian product. The Cartesian product does not satisfy the pushout-product axiom for the Joyal model structure.

However, the Cartesian product preserves categorical equivalences between cofibrant objects (which is all objects, since cofibrations are monomorphisms), so the product is well-behaved on the homotopy category.
</Example>

<Example id="joyal-enrichment" title="Self-enrichment">
The Joyal model structure is enriched over itself in the following sense: for quasi-categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$, the functor category $\operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$ is a quasi-category, and this construction is homotopy invariant.

The "mapping space" in the Joyal sense is $\operatorname{Map}^J(X, Y) = \operatorname{Fun}(X, Y)^\simeq$ (the core of the functor category), which is a Kan complex.
</Example>

## Fibrant Replacement

<Example id="joyal-fibrant-replacement" title="Joyal fibrant replacement">
Given a simplicial set $X$, its Joyal fibrant replacement is a quasi-category $\mathcal{C}$ with a categorical equivalence $X \xrightarrow{\sim} \mathcal{C}$. This can be constructed via:

1. **Small object argument**: Iteratively fill all inner horns.
2. **Coherent nerve**: If $X$ comes from a simplicial category, use the coherent nerve $N_\Delta$.
3. **Localization**: If $X = N(\mathcal{M})$ for a model category, the Dwyer--Kan localization $N(\mathcal{M})[W^{-1}]$ is a quasi-category.

The Joyal fibrant replacement of a Kan complex $K$ is $K$ itself (Kan complexes are quasi-categories).
</Example>

<Example id="joyal-vs-kan-replacement" title="Joyal vs. Kan fibrant replacement">
For a quasi-category $\mathcal{C}$:
- **Joyal fibrant replacement**: $\mathcal{C}$ itself (already fibrant).
- **Kan fibrant replacement**: The underlying $\infty$-groupoid $\mathcal{C}^\simeq$ (the core) -- but this loses the non-invertible morphisms.

For the nerve $N([1]) = \Delta[1]$:
- Joyal fibrant: $\Delta[1]$ (already a quasi-category).
- Kan fibrant: $\operatorname{Ex}^\infty(\Delta[1])$, which is a contractible Kan complex (since $[0,1]$ is contractible).

The Kan fibrant replacement "groupoid-ifies" by making all morphisms invertible.
</Example>

## Summary

<Remark title="Key points">
The Joyal model structure provides the foundation for $\infty$-category theory:

1. **Fibrant objects** are quasi-categories; **weak equivalences** are categorical equivalences.

2. **Cofibrations** are monomorphisms (same as Kan--Quillen), so all objects are cofibrant.

3. **Inner fibrations** model families of $\infty$-categories; **left/right fibrations** model functors to spaces.

4. The Joyal model structure is **different** from Kan--Quillen: it has more weak equivalences and fewer fibrant objects.

5. It is **left proper** and **cofibrantly generated**, providing the technical foundation for Lurie's work in HTT and HA.
