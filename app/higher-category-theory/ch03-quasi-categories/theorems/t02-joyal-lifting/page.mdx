# Joyal Lifting Theorem

The Joyal lifting theorem establishes the existence of the Joyal model structure on $\mathbf{sSet}$ by characterizing its fibrations, trivial fibrations, and weak equivalences. It provides the key technical results needed to develop the theory of quasi-categories, including the characterization of categorical equivalences, the behavior of inner fibrations, and the lifting properties that make the theory work.

## Main Results

<Theorem title="Joyal's existence theorem" number="3.1">
The category $\mathbf{sSet}$ admits a left proper, cofibrantly generated model structure (the **Joyal model structure**) in which:

1. The cofibrations are the monomorphisms.
2. The fibrant objects are the quasi-categories.
3. A map $f: X \to Y$ between quasi-categories is a fibration if and only if it is an **isofibration**: an inner fibration such that every equivalence in $Y$ lying over an object of $X$ lifts to an equivalence in $X$.
4. The weak equivalences between quasi-categories are the **categorical equivalences**: fully faithful and essentially surjective functors.
</Theorem>

<Theorem title="Joyal lifting theorem for inner fibrations" number="3.2">
Let $p: X \to S$ be an inner fibration and let $e: s \to s'$ be an equivalence in $S$ (i.e., an isomorphism in the homotopy category $\operatorname{h}S$). Then for any lift $\bar{s}$ of $s$ (i.e., $p(\bar{s}) = s$), the equivalence $e$ lifts to an equivalence $\bar{e}: \bar{s} \to \bar{s}'$ in $X$ with $p(\bar{e}) = e$.

In other words, inner fibrations have the lifting property for equivalences, not just for inner horns.
</Theorem>

## Key Lemmas

<Example id="inner-fib-fiber" title="Fibers of inner fibrations">
If $p: X \to S$ is an inner fibration and $s \in S_0$ is a vertex, the fiber $X_s = p^{-1}(s)$ is a quasi-category. This follows because inner horn fillers in $X$ lying over degenerate simplices in $S$ (at the vertex $s$) provide inner horn fillers in $X_s$.

This shows that inner fibrations are indeed "families of quasi-categories."
</Example>

<Example id="equivalence-lifting" title="Equivalence lifting property">
The lifting theorem for equivalences is stronger than just lifting inner horns. It states that in an inner fibration $p: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$, equivalences in $\mathcal{D}$ can always be lifted to equivalences in $\mathcal{C}$ (given a lift of the source).

This is the $\infty$-categorical analogue of the path-lifting property for covering spaces and fibrations. In an isofibration (Joyal fibration), the lift can be chosen to start at any specified point.
</Example>

<Example id="joyal-characterization-we" title="Characterization of Joyal weak equivalences">
A map $f: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ between quasi-categories is a Joyal weak equivalence (categorical equivalence) if and only if:

1. The induced functor $\operatorname{h}f: \operatorname{h}\mathcal{C} \to \operatorname{h}\mathcal{D}$ on homotopy categories is an equivalence of ordinary categories.
2. For all objects $x, y \in \mathcal{C}$, the induced map $\operatorname{Map}_{\mathcal{C}}(x, y) \to \operatorname{Map}_{\mathcal{D}}(f(x), f(y))$ is a weak homotopy equivalence.

Equivalently, $f$ is a categorical equivalence if it is **essentially surjective** (every object of $\mathcal{D}$ is equivalent to one in the image of $f$) and **fully faithful** (the mapping space comparison is a weak equivalence).
</Example>

## Applications

<Example id="app-functor-categories" title="Functor categories are quasi-categories">
A crucial consequence: if $\mathcal{D}$ is a quasi-category and $K$ is any simplicial set, then $\operatorname{Fun}(K, \mathcal{D}) = \mathcal{D}^K$ is a quasi-category. The proof uses the Joyal model structure: the exponential $\mathcal{D}^K$ is fibrant (a quasi-category) whenever $\mathcal{D}$ is fibrant.

This justifies the use of functor categories throughout $\infty$-category theory without needing to verify the quasi-category axiom each time.
</Example>

<Example id="app-overcategory" title="Over and under categories">
For a quasi-category $\mathcal{C}$ and an object $c \in \mathcal{C}$, the **overcategory** (or **slice**) $\mathcal{C}_{/c}$ and **undercategory** $\mathcal{C}_{c/}$ are quasi-categories. These are defined as simplicial sets with:

$$(\mathcal{C}_{/c})_n = \operatorname{Hom}_c(\Delta[n] \star \Delta[0], \mathcal{C})$$

The Joyal lifting theorem ensures that the forgetful functor $\mathcal{C}_{/c} \to \mathcal{C}$ is a right fibration, and the forgetful functor $\mathcal{C}_{c/} \to \mathcal{C}$ is a left fibration.
</Example>

<Example id="app-straightening" title="Foundation for straightening/unstraightening">
The Joyal model structure and lifting theorem provide the foundation for Lurie's **straightening/unstraightening equivalence**:

$$\operatorname{St}: \mathbf{sSet}_{/S}^{\text{left fib}} \xrightarrow{\;\simeq\;} \operatorname{Fun}(S, \mathcal{S}): \operatorname{Un}$$

This equivalence identifies left fibrations $X \to S$ with functors $S \to \mathcal{S}$ (from $S$ to the $\infty$-category of spaces). It is the $\infty$-categorical Grothendieck construction and is fundamental to the entire theory.

The Joyal lifting theorem ensures that the fibers of a left fibration are Kan complexes (spaces), making this identification possible.
</Example>

<Example id="app-joyal-vs-bergner" title="Comparison with other models">
The Joyal model structure on $\mathbf{sSet}$ is Quillen equivalent to:
- The **Bergner model structure** on simplicial categories (via the coherent nerve $N_\Delta \dashv \mathfrak{C}$).
- The **Rezk model structure** on bisimplicial sets (complete Segal spaces).
- The **Segal category model structure**.

These Quillen equivalences show that quasi-categories, simplicial categories, complete Segal spaces, and Segal categories all provide equivalent models for $(\infty, 1)$-categories.
</Example>

<Example id="app-limits-colimits" title="Existence of limits and colimits">
The Joyal model structure provides the technical foundation for proving that quasi-categories have limits and colimits. Specifically:

- **Representability**: A functor $F: K \to \mathcal{C}$ has a limit if and only if the canonical map $\mathcal{C} \to \operatorname{Fun}(K, \mathcal{C})$ has a right adjoint.
- **Construction**: Limits in $\mathcal{C}$ are computed as terminal objects of the appropriate slice category $\mathcal{C}_{/F}$.

The lifting properties of isofibrations are essential for establishing the universal properties of these constructions.
</Example>

## Historical Notes

<Remark title="History">
The Joyal model structure was introduced by Andre Joyal in his unpublished manuscript "Quasi-categories and Kan complexes" (circa 2002) and his notes on "The Theory of Quasi-categories" (2008). The existence proof is technically demanding, requiring careful analysis of the combinatorics of inner horn fillers and the behavior of categorical equivalences.

Joyal's work built on the earlier observation by Boardman--Vogt (1973) that weak Kan complexes (quasi-categories) provide a model for homotopy-coherent categories. Lurie's "Higher Topos Theory" (2009) developed the full theory of $\infty$-categories using the Joyal model structure as its foundation.
</Remark>

## Summary

<Remark title="Key points">
The Joyal lifting theorem and model structure provide the technical foundation for $\infty$-category theory:

1. The **Joyal model structure** has quasi-categories as fibrant objects and categorical equivalences as weak equivalences.

2. **Inner fibrations** have the lifting property for equivalences, making fibers into quasi-categories.

3. **Isofibrations** (Joyal fibrations) additionally lift equivalences starting at specified points.

4. The model structure is **Quillen equivalent** to simplicial categories, complete Segal spaces, and Segal categories.

5. It provides the foundation for **functor categories**, **slice categories**, **limits/colimits**, and the **straightening/unstraightening** equivalence.
