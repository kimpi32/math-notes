# Solvability by Radicals

The classical question that motivated Galois theory: *can the roots of a polynomial be expressed using the arithmetic operations and radicals (i.e., $n$-th roots)?* Galois's breakthrough was to translate this into the question of whether the Galois group is **solvable**.

## Radical extensions

<Definition title="Radical extension" number="5.20">
A field extension $E/F$ is a **radical extension** (or **extension by radicals**) if there exists a tower of fields

$$F = F_0 \subset F_1 \subset F_2 \subset \cdots \subset F_r = E$$

where each $F_{i+1} = F_i(\alpha_i)$ with $\alpha_i^{n_i} \in F_i$ for some positive integer $n_i$. That is, each step adjoins an $n_i$-th root of an element of the previous field.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Solvable by radicals" number="5.21">
A polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is **solvable by radicals** if there exists a radical extension $E/F$ containing all roots of $f$. In other words, the roots of $f$ can be expressed using field operations and extraction of roots.
</Definition>

<Example id="quadratic-radical" title="Quadratic equations">
Every quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$ is solvable by radicals: the roots are

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$

The radical extension is $F(\sqrt{b^2-4ac})/F$, which adjoins a single square root.
</Example>

<Example id="cubic-radical" title="Cubic equations (Cardano's formula)">
Every cubic $x^3 + px + q$ (after depressing) is solvable by radicals via **Cardano's formula**:

$$x = \sqrt[3]{-\frac{q}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4} + \frac{p^3}{27}}} + \sqrt[3]{-\frac{q}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4} + \frac{p^3}{27}}}.$$

The radical tower involves: adjoin a square root, then a cube root. The other roots are obtained by multiplying by cube roots of unity.
</Example>

<Example id="quartic-radical" title="Quartic equations">
Every quartic is solvable by radicals (Ferrari, 1540). The method reduces a quartic to a cubic (the **resolvent cubic**), which is then solved by Cardano's formula. The radical tower involves square roots and cube roots.
</Example>

<Example id="x5-1" title="Roots of unity">
$x^n - 1$ is always solvable by radicals: the roots are $\zeta_n^k = e^{2\pi i k/n}$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$. The extension $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)/\mathbb{Q}$ has abelian Galois group $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$, which is always solvable.
</Example>

## Solvable groups

<Definition title="Solvable group" number="5.22">
A group $G$ is **solvable** if there exists a chain of subgroups

$$\{e\} = G_0 \trianglelefteq G_1 \trianglelefteq G_2 \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq G_r = G$$

where each quotient $G_{i+1}/G_i$ is abelian. This is called a **solvable series** (or **subnormal series with abelian factors**).
</Definition>

<Example id="abelian-solvable" title="Abelian groups are solvable">
Every abelian group $G$ is solvable: the series $\{e\} \trianglelefteq G$ has the single quotient $G/\{e\} \cong G$, which is abelian.
</Example>

<Example id="s3-solvable" title="S_3 is solvable">
$S_3$ has the series $\{e\} \trianglelefteq A_3 \trianglelefteq S_3$ where:
- $A_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ is abelian
- $S_3/A_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is abelian

So $S_3$ is solvable.
</Example>

<Example id="s4-solvable" title="S_4 is solvable">
$S_4$ has the solvable series:

$$\{e\} \trianglelefteq V_4 \trianglelefteq A_4 \trianglelefteq S_4$$

where $V_4 = \{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\}$ is the Klein four-group. The quotients are:
- $V_4/\{e\} \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ (abelian)
- $A_4/V_4 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ (abelian)
- $S_4/A_4 \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ (abelian)
</Example>

<Example id="s5-not-solvable" title="S_5 is not solvable">
$S_5$ is **not** solvable. The key reason: $A_5$ is **simple** (has no nontrivial normal subgroups). So any normal series of $S_5$ must include $A_5$:

$$\{e\} \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq A_5 \trianglelefteq S_5.$$

But $A_5$ is nonabelian and simple, so it cannot be further refined. The quotient $A_5/\{e\} = A_5$ is not abelian, and there is no normal subgroup to insert between $\{e\}$ and $A_5$.

More generally, $S_n$ is not solvable for any $n \ge 5$.
</Example>

<Example id="d4-solvable" title="D_4 is solvable">
The dihedral group $D_4$ of order $8$ is solvable:

$$\{e\} \trianglelefteq \langle r^2 \rangle \trianglelefteq \langle r \rangle \trianglelefteq D_4$$

where $r$ is the rotation by $90°$. Each quotient is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.
</Example>

## The Galois criterion for solvability

<Theorem title="Galois's theorem on solvability" number="5.18">
Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and $f(x) \in F[x]$ a polynomial with splitting field $E$. Then $f$ is solvable by radicals if and only if $\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)$ is a solvable group.
</Theorem>

<Remark title="Key idea of the proof">
The proof connects two hierarchies:
- **Radical tower**: $F = F_0 \subset F_1 \subset \cdots \subset F_r$ where each step adjoins a root $\alpha_i^{n_i} \in F_{i-1}$.
- **Solvable series**: $\{e\} = G_r \trianglelefteq G_{r-1} \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq G_0 = G$ with cyclic quotients.

Adjoining an $n$-th root corresponds (after ensuring roots of unity are available) to a cyclic extension of degree dividing $n$, and cyclic groups are abelian. The correspondence reverses the order (larger fields correspond to smaller subgroups via the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory).
</Remark>

<Example id="cubic-solvable" title="Cubics are solvable">
For an irreducible cubic $f(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, the Galois group is either $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ or $S_3$, both of which are solvable. Hence all cubics are solvable by radicals, consistent with Cardano's formula.
</Example>

<Example id="quartic-solvable" title="Quartics are solvable">
For an irreducible quartic $f(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$: one of $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$, $V_4$, $D_4$, $A_4$, or $S_4$. All of these are solvable (since $S_4$ is solvable). Hence all quartics are solvable by radicals.
</Example>

<Example id="quintic-not-solvable" title="A specific unsolvable quintic">
The polynomial $f(x) = x^5 - 4x + 2 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ is irreducible (by Eisenstein with $p = 2$). It has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots. The Galois group $\operatorname{Gal}(E/\mathbb{Q}) \cong S_5$ (since it contains a transposition from complex conjugation and a $5$-cycle from the irreducibility over $\mathbb{Q}$, and these generate $S_5$). Since $S_5$ is not solvable, this polynomial is **not solvable by radicals**.
</Example>

## Cyclic extensions and Kummer theory

<Definition title="Cyclic extension" number="5.23">
A Galois extension $E/F$ is **cyclic** if $\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)$ is a cyclic group.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Kummer theory" number="5.19">
Let $F$ be a field containing a primitive $n$-th root of unity $\zeta_n$ (and $\operatorname{char}(F) \nmid n$). Then:
1. Every cyclic extension $E/F$ of degree $n$ has the form $E = F(\sqrt[n]{a})$ for some $a \in F^\times$.
2. Conversely, if $a \in F^\times$ and $x^n - a$ is irreducible over $F$, then $F(\sqrt[n]{a})/F$ is cyclic of degree $n$.
</Theorem>

<Example id="kummer-degree2" title="Kummer theory for n=2">
Over $\mathbb{Q}$ (which contains $-1 = \zeta_2$): every quadratic extension is $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{a})$ for some squarefree $a \in \mathbb{Z}$. The Galois group is always $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.
</Example>

<Example id="kummer-degree3" title="Kummer theory for n=3">
Over $\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$: every cyclic cubic extension is $\mathbb{Q}(\omega, \sqrt[3]{a})$ for some $a$. For example, $\mathbb{Q}(\omega, \sqrt[3]{2})/\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$ is cyclic of degree $3$.
</Example>

## Classical geometric constructions

<Example id="doubling-cube" title="Doubling the cube is impossible">
Doubling the cube requires constructing $\sqrt[3]{2}$, which has minimal polynomial $x^3 - 2$ of degree $3$. But compass-and-straightedge constructions can only produce extensions of degree $2^k$, and $3 \nmid 2^k$ for any $k$. So **doubling the cube is impossible** with compass and straightedge.
</Example>

<Example id="trisecting-angle" title="Trisecting an arbitrary angle is impossible">
Trisecting $60°$ requires constructing $\cos 20°$, which satisfies $8x^3 - 6x - 1 = 0$ (an irreducible cubic over $\mathbb{Q}$). Since degree $3 \nmid 2^k$, **trisecting an arbitrary angle is impossible** with compass and straightedge.
</Example>

<Example id="regular-ngon" title="Constructing regular n-gons">
A regular $n$-gon is constructible with compass and straightedge if and only if

$$n = 2^k p_1 p_2 \cdots p_s$$

where $p_1, \ldots, p_s$ are distinct **Fermat primes** (primes of the form $2^{2^m} + 1$). The known Fermat primes are $3, 5, 17, 257, 65537$.

So the regular $7$-gon is **not** constructible (since $7$ is not a Fermat prime), but the regular $17$-gon **is** (Gauss, 1796).
</Example>

---

## From solvable groups to radical expressions

<Example id="solving-x4-2" title="Solving x^4 - 2 by radicals">
$\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)/\mathbb{Q}) \cong D_4$, which is solvable with series

$$\{e\} \trianglelefteq \langle r^2 \rangle \trianglelefteq \langle r \rangle \trianglelefteq D_4.$$

The corresponding tower of fixed fields is

$$\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Q}(i) \subset \mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt{2}) \subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{2}, i).$$

Each step is a cyclic extension of degree $2$: adjoin $i = \sqrt{-1}$, then $\sqrt{2}$, then $\sqrt[4]{2} = \sqrt{\sqrt{2}}$. So the roots are expressible via nested square roots: $\pm\sqrt[4]{2}$ and $\pm i\sqrt[4]{2}$.
</Example>

## Summary

| Degree | Galois group possibilities | Solvable? | Radical formula? |
|---|---|---|---|
| $2$ | $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ | Yes | Quadratic formula |
| $3$ | $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$, $S_3$ | Yes | Cardano's formula |
| $4$ | $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$, $V_4$, $D_4$, $A_4$, $S_4$ | Yes | Ferrari's method |
| $5$ | Various subgroups of $S_5$ | Not always | No general formula |
| $\ge 5$ | Can have $S_n$ or $A_n$ | Not always | No general formula |

<Remark title="Looking ahead">
The [Abel-Ruffini theorem](/modern-algebra/ch05-fields-galois/theorems/t03-abel-ruffini) formalizes the impossibility for degree $\ge 5$: there is no formula in radicals for the general quintic. This relies on the non-solvability of $S_5$ (and more precisely $A_5$).
