# Rings and Ring Homomorphisms

A ring is an algebraic structure that generalizes the integers: it has both addition and multiplication, with addition forming an abelian group, and multiplication distributing over addition. Rings are the natural setting for studying factorization, divisibility, and polynomial equations.

## Definition of a Ring

<Definition title="Ring" number="4.1">
A **ring** is a set $R$ together with two binary operations $+$ (addition) and $\cdot$ (multiplication) satisfying:

1. $(R, +)$ is an **abelian group** with identity element $0$.
2. Multiplication is **associative**: $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c \in R$.
3. There exists a **multiplicative identity** $1 \in R$ such that $1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a$ for all $a \in R$.
4. **Distributive laws**: For all $a, b, c \in R$:

$$a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c \quad \text{and} \quad (a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c$$
</Definition>

<Remark title="Convention on unity">
Some authors do not require a multiplicative identity $1$, calling such a structure a "rng" (ring without identity). In this course, all rings are assumed to have a multiplicative identity $1$, and we require $1 \neq 0$ (so the zero ring, where $1 = 0$, is excluded by some authors but we allow it as the trivial ring).
</Remark>

<Definition title="Commutative ring" number="4.2">
A ring $R$ is **commutative** if $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a, b \in R$.
</Definition>

## Basic Properties

<Theorem title="Elementary properties of rings" number="4.1">
Let $R$ be a ring. For all $a, b \in R$:

1. $0 \cdot a = a \cdot 0 = 0$.
2. $(-a) \cdot b = a \cdot (-b) = -(a \cdot b)$.
3. $(-a)(-b) = ab$.
4. If $R$ has unity $1$, then $(-1) \cdot a = -a$.
</Theorem>

## Important Classes of Rings

<Definition title="Units and division rings" number="4.3">
An element $u \in R$ is a **unit** (or invertible element) if there exists $v \in R$ with $uv = vu = 1$. The set of all units of $R$ is denoted $R^\times$ and forms a group under multiplication, called the **group of units**.

A ring $R$ in which every nonzero element is a unit (i.e., $R^\times = R \setminus \{0\}$) is called a **division ring** (or skew field). A commutative division ring is a **field**.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Integral domain" number="4.4">
A commutative ring $R$ is an **integral domain** if $R \neq 0$ and whenever $ab = 0$ in $R$, either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ (i.e., $R$ has no zero divisors).
</Definition>

<Definition title="Zero divisor" number="4.5">
A nonzero element $a \in R$ is a **zero divisor** if there exists a nonzero $b \in R$ with $ab = 0$ or $ba = 0$.
</Definition>

## Examples of Rings

<Example id="integers" title="The integers">
$\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring, in fact an integral domain. The group of units is $\mathbb{Z}^\times = \{1, -1\}$.
</Example>

<Example id="modular" title="Modular arithmetic">
For any $n \geq 1$, $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring. It is a field if and only if $n$ is prime. For composite $n$, it has zero divisors: in $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$, we have $\bar{2} \cdot \bar{3} = \bar{0}$.
</Example>

<Example id="polynomial" title="Polynomial ring">
For any commutative ring $R$, the polynomial ring $R[x]$ consists of formal polynomials $\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$ with $a_i \in R$. It is commutative if $R$ is commutative. If $R$ is an integral domain, so is $R[x]$.
</Example>

<Example id="matrix" title="Matrix rings">
For any ring $R$ and $n \geq 1$, the set $M_n(R)$ of $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $R$ forms a ring under matrix addition and multiplication. For $n \geq 2$, $M_n(R)$ is **not commutative** even when $R$ is commutative. For example, in $M_2(\mathbb{R})$, if $A$ has entries $a_{11} = a_{12} = 1$, $a_{21} = a_{22} = 0$ and $B$ has entries $b_{11} = b_{22} = 0$, $b_{21} = 1$, $b_{12} = 0$, then $AB$ has $(1,1)$-entry $1$ and all other entries $0$, while $BA$ has $(2,1)$-entry $1$, $(2,2)$-entry $1$, and first row all zeros. In particular $AB \neq BA$.
</Example>

<Example id="quaternions" title="The quaternions">
The **Hamilton quaternions** $\mathbb{H}$ consist of elements $a + bi + cj + dk$ with $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$, where $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$. This implies $ij = k, jk = i, ki = j$ and $ji = -k, kj = -i, ik = -j$. The quaternions form a noncommutative division ring.
</Example>

<Example id="endomorphism" title="Endomorphism ring">
For any abelian group $(A, +)$, the set $\mathrm{End}(A)$ of group homomorphisms $A \to A$ forms a ring under pointwise addition $(f+g)(a) = f(a) + g(a)$ and composition $(f \cdot g)(a) = f(g(a))$. This ring is generally noncommutative.
</Example>

<Example id="gaussian" title="Gaussian integers">
The **Gaussian integers** $\mathbb{Z}[i] = \{a + bi : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ form a subring of $\mathbb{C}$. It is an integral domain (as a subring of a field). The units are $\mathbb{Z}[i]^\times = \{1, -1, i, -i\}$.
</Example>

<Example id="function-ring" title="Ring of continuous functions">
For a topological space $X$, the set $C(X, \mathbb{R})$ of continuous functions $X \to \mathbb{R}$ forms a commutative ring under pointwise addition and multiplication. If $X$ has more than one point, this ring has zero divisors: take functions supported on disjoint open sets.
</Example>

<Example id="trivial-ring" title="The zero ring">
The zero ring $\{0\}$ with $0 = 1$ is a ring. It is the terminal object in the category of rings. Note: it is NOT an integral domain (by convention, integral domains must satisfy $1 \neq 0$).
</Example>

<Example id="direct-product" title="Direct product of rings">
If $R$ and $S$ are rings, then $R \times S$ is a ring with componentwise operations: $(r_1, s_1) + (r_2, s_2) = (r_1 + r_2, s_1 + s_2)$ and $(r_1, s_1)(r_2, s_2) = (r_1 r_2, s_1 s_2)$. The identity is $(1_R, 1_S)$. Note that $R \times S$ always has zero divisors when both $R$ and $S$ are nonzero: $(1, 0) \cdot (0, 1) = (0, 0)$.
</Example>

---

## Subrings

<Definition title="Subring" number="4.6">
A subset $S \subseteq R$ is a **subring** if:

1. $S$ is closed under addition and multiplication.
2. $0 \in S$ and $1 \in S$.
3. For every $a \in S$, $-a \in S$.

Equivalently, $S$ is a subring if $S$ is a ring under the operations inherited from $R$ and $1_S = 1_R$.
</Definition>

<Example id="subring-examples" title="Subrings of familiar rings">
- $\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is a chain of subrings.
- $\mathbb{Z}[i] \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is a subring.
- $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b\sqrt{2} : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subring.
- The upper triangular matrices form a subring of $M_n(R)$.
</Example>

## Ring Homomorphisms

<Definition title="Ring homomorphism" number="4.7">
Let $R$ and $S$ be rings. A **ring homomorphism** is a function $\varphi: R \to S$ satisfying:

1. $\varphi(a + b) = \varphi(a) + \varphi(b)$ for all $a, b \in R$.
2. $\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)$ for all $a, b \in R$.
3. $\varphi(1_R) = 1_S$.
</Definition>

<Remark title="Preserving unity">
Condition (3) is essential: the map $\varphi: \mathbb{Z} \to M_2(\mathbb{Z})$ sending $n$ to the matrix with $n$ in the $(1,1)$-entry and $0$ elsewhere satisfies (1) and (2) but not (3), and is not considered a ring homomorphism.
</Remark>

<Definition title="Ring isomorphism" number="4.8">
A ring homomorphism $\varphi: R \to S$ is a **ring isomorphism** if it is bijective. We write $R \cong S$ and say $R$ and $S$ are **isomorphic**. An isomorphism from $R$ to itself is an **automorphism**.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Kernel of a ring homomorphism" number="4.9">
The **kernel** of a ring homomorphism $\varphi: R \to S$ is

$$\ker(\varphi) = \{r \in R : \varphi(r) = 0_S\}$$

The **image** of $\varphi$ is $\mathrm{im}(\varphi) = \varphi(R) = \{\varphi(r) : r \in R\}$.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Properties of ring homomorphisms" number="4.2">
Let $\varphi: R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Then:

1. $\varphi(0_R) = 0_S$ and $\varphi(-a) = -\varphi(a)$ for all $a \in R$.
2. $\ker(\varphi)$ is an ideal of $R$ (not just a subgroup).
3. $\mathrm{im}(\varphi)$ is a subring of $S$.
4. $\varphi$ is injective if and only if $\ker(\varphi) = \{0\}$.
5. If $u \in R^\times$, then $\varphi(u) \in S^\times$ and $\varphi(u^{-1}) = \varphi(u)^{-1}$.
</Theorem>

## Examples of Ring Homomorphisms

<Example id="evaluation" title="Evaluation homomorphism">
For a commutative ring $R$ and $a \in R$, the **evaluation map** $\mathrm{ev}_a: R[x] \to R$ defined by $f(x) \mapsto f(a)$ is a ring homomorphism. Its kernel is the set of polynomials vanishing at $a$.
</Example>

<Example id="reduction" title="Reduction modulo n">
The natural map $\pi: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ sending $a \mapsto \bar{a}$ is a surjective ring homomorphism with $\ker(\pi) = n\mathbb{Z}$.
</Example>

<Example id="complex-conjugation" title="Complex conjugation">
The map $\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ sending $z \mapsto \bar{z}$ is a ring automorphism (in fact, a field automorphism). It has order $2$ and $\ker = \{0\}$.
</Example>

<Example id="characteristic" title="Characteristic of a ring">
For any ring $R$, there is a unique ring homomorphism $\chi: \mathbb{Z} \to R$ defined by $\chi(n) = n \cdot 1_R$. The kernel of $\chi$ is of the form $m\mathbb{Z}$ for a unique $m \geq 0$. This $m$ is the **characteristic** of $R$, denoted $\mathrm{char}(R)$.

If $R$ is an integral domain, then $\mathrm{char}(R)$ is either $0$ or a prime number $p$.
</Example>

---

## The Characteristic of a Ring

<Example id="char-examples" title="Characteristics of familiar rings">
- $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{R}) = 0$, $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{C}) = 0$.
- $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}) = n$.
- $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{F}_p) = p$ for a prime $p$.
- $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}) = 6$ (not prime, so $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$ is not an integral domain).
</Example>

<Theorem title="Freshman's dream" number="4.3">
Let $R$ be a commutative ring of characteristic $p$ (a prime). Then for all $a, b \in R$:

$$(a + b)^p = a^p + b^p$$

More generally, $(a + b)^{p^n} = a^{p^n} + b^{p^n}$ for all $n \geq 1$. The map $\varphi: R \to R$ defined by $\varphi(a) = a^p$ is a ring homomorphism, called the **Frobenius endomorphism**.
</Theorem>

## Summary

<Remark title="Hierarchy of ring structures">
The key hierarchy of algebraic structures studied in ring theory is:

$$\text{Ring} \supset \text{Commutative Ring} \supset \text{Integral Domain} \supset \text{UFD} \supset \text{PID} \supset \text{Euclidean Domain} \supset \text{Field}$$

Each inclusion is strict, as we will see in subsequent sections. Rings serve as the foundation for studying ideals, quotient constructions, polynomial rings, and ultimately field theory and Galois theory.
