# Ideals and Quotient Rings

Ideals are to rings what normal subgroups are to groups: they are the kernels of ring homomorphisms and the objects we quotient by to form new rings. The theory of ideals is central to commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

## Definition of an Ideal

<Definition title="Ideal" number="4.10">
Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $I \subseteq R$ is a **(two-sided) ideal** if:

1. $(I, +)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +)$ (i.e., $0 \in I$, and $a - b \in I$ for all $a, b \in I$).
2. For all $r \in R$ and $a \in I$: $ra \in I$ and $ar \in I$.

If only condition (2) with $ra \in I$ holds, $I$ is a **left ideal**. If only $ar \in I$ holds, $I$ is a **right ideal**. For commutative rings, left, right, and two-sided ideals coincide.
</Definition>

<Remark title="Ideals vs. subrings">
An ideal is always an additive subgroup but is generally NOT a subring. In fact, if an ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ contains $1$, then $I = R$ (since for any $r \in R$, $r = r \cdot 1 \in I$). So the only ideal that is also a subring (containing $1$) is $R$ itself.
</Remark>

## Examples of Ideals

<Example id="trivial-ideals" title="Trivial ideals">
Every ring $R$ has two trivial ideals: $\{0\}$ (the zero ideal) and $R$ itself. An ideal $I$ with $I \neq R$ is called a **proper ideal**. A ring where the only ideals are $\{0\}$ and $R$ is called a **simple ring**.
</Example>

<Example id="nZ" title="Ideals of the integers">
Every ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $n\mathbb{Z} = \{nk : k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ for some $n \geq 0$. This is because $\mathbb{Z}$ is a principal ideal domain: every ideal is generated by a single element.
</Example>

<Example id="principal" title="Principal ideals">
For any element $a$ in a commutative ring $R$, the set $(a) = aR = \{ar : r \in R\}$ is an ideal called the **principal ideal generated by $a$**. For instance, $(x) = xR[x]$ consists of all polynomials with zero constant term.
</Example>

<Example id="generated-ideal" title="Ideals generated by a set">
For elements $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ in a commutative ring $R$, the ideal generated by these elements is

$$(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \{r_1 a_1 + \cdots + r_n a_n : r_i \in R\}$$

For example, $(2, x) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}[x]$ consists of polynomials whose constant term is even.
</Example>

<Example id="kernel-ideal" title="Kernel is an ideal">
If $\varphi: R \to S$ is a ring homomorphism, then $\ker(\varphi)$ is an ideal of $R$. Conversely, every ideal arises as the kernel of some homomorphism (the quotient map).
</Example>

<Example id="matrix-ideal" title="Ideals in matrix rings">
The ring $M_n(k)$ of $n \times n$ matrices over a field $k$ is a simple ring when $n \geq 1$: its only two-sided ideals are $\{0\}$ and $M_n(k)$. However, it has many left ideals and right ideals.
</Example>

## Special Types of Ideals

<Definition title="Maximal ideal" number="4.11">
A proper ideal $\mathfrak{m} \subset R$ is **maximal** if there is no ideal $I$ with $\mathfrak{m} \subsetneq I \subsetneq R$. In other words, $\mathfrak{m}$ is maximal among proper ideals under inclusion.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Prime ideal" number="4.12">
A proper ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subset R$ (where $R$ is commutative) is **prime** if whenever $ab \in \mathfrak{p}$, either $a \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $b \in \mathfrak{p}$.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Maximal implies prime" number="4.4">
In a commutative ring $R$, every maximal ideal is prime.
</Theorem>

<Example id="prime-maximal-Z" title="Prime and maximal ideals of the integers">
In $\mathbb{Z}$, the prime ideals are $(0)$ and $(p)$ for primes $p$. The maximal ideals are exactly $(p)$ for primes $p$. Note that $(0)$ is prime but not maximal.
</Example>

<Example id="prime-polynomial" title="Prime ideals in polynomial rings">
In $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, examples of prime ideals include:
- $(0)$ (since $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is an integral domain).
- $(p)$ for a prime $p$ (since $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(p) \cong \mathbb{F}_p[x]$ is an integral domain).
- $(x)$ (since $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain).
- $(2, x)$ (since $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(2, x) \cong \mathbb{F}_2$ is a field, so this is also maximal).

Note that $(2)$ is prime but not maximal: $(2) \subsetneq (2, x) \subsetneq \mathbb{Z}[x]$.
</Example>

## Quotient Rings

<Definition title="Quotient ring" number="4.13">
Let $I$ be an ideal of a ring $R$. The **quotient ring** (or **factor ring**) $R/I$ is the set of cosets

$$R/I = \{r + I : r \in R\}$$

with operations $(r + I) + (s + I) = (r + s) + I$ and $(r + I)(s + I) = rs + I$. These operations are well-defined precisely because $I$ is an ideal.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Quotient ring is a ring" number="4.5">
If $I$ is an ideal of $R$, then $R/I$ is a ring with identity $1 + I$. The natural projection $\pi: R \to R/I$ defined by $\pi(r) = r + I$ is a surjective ring homomorphism with $\ker(\pi) = I$.
</Theorem>

<Theorem title="Characterization via quotients" number="4.6">
Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $I$ a proper ideal of $R$. Then:

1. $R/I$ is a field if and only if $I$ is a maximal ideal.
2. $R/I$ is an integral domain if and only if $I$ is a prime ideal.
</Theorem>

## Examples of Quotient Rings

<Example id="Z-mod-n" title="Integers modulo n">
$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is the quotient of $\mathbb{Z}$ by the ideal $n\mathbb{Z}$. By the theorem above, $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a field iff $n\mathbb{Z}$ is maximal iff $n$ is prime.
</Example>

<Example id="polynomial-quotient" title="Quotient of polynomial ring">
Consider $\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2 + 1)$. Every element can be written as $a + bx + (x^2 + 1)$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, using the relation $x^2 = -1$ in the quotient. This gives $\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2 + 1) \cong \mathbb{C}$, where $x + (x^2 + 1)$ corresponds to $i$.
</Example>

<Example id="dual-numbers" title="The ring of dual numbers">
$\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2)$ is the ring of **dual numbers** $\mathbb{R}[\epsilon]$ where $\epsilon^2 = 0$. Elements look like $a + b\epsilon$ with $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$. This ring is NOT an integral domain since $\epsilon \neq 0$ but $\epsilon^2 = 0$. It appears in algebraic geometry (tangent vectors) and automatic differentiation.
</Example>

<Example id="quotient-F2" title="A finite field of four elements">
Consider $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^2 + x + 1)$. The polynomial $x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{F}_2$ (it has no roots: $0^2 + 0 + 1 = 1 \neq 0$ and $1^2 + 1 + 1 = 1 \neq 0$). So $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^2 + x + 1) \cong \mathbb{F}_4$, a field with $4$ elements.
</Example>

## Operations on Ideals

<Definition title="Ideal operations" number="4.14">
Let $I$ and $J$ be ideals of a commutative ring $R$.

- **Sum**: $I + J = \{a + b : a \in I, b \in J\}$, the smallest ideal containing both $I$ and $J$.
- **Product**: $IJ = \{\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k : a_k \in I, b_k \in J, n \geq 1\}$, NOT just pairwise products.
- **Intersection**: $I \cap J$ is always an ideal.
- **Radical**: $\sqrt{I} = \{r \in R : r^n \in I \text{ for some } n \geq 1\}$.
</Definition>

<Example id="ideal-operations" title="Ideal operations in the integers">
In $\mathbb{Z}$:
- $(m) + (n) = (\gcd(m, n))$.
- $(m) \cap (n) = (\mathrm{lcm}(m, n))$.
- $(m)(n) = (mn)$.
- $\sqrt{(12)} = \sqrt{(2^2 \cdot 3)} = (2 \cdot 3) = (6)$.
</Example>

<Theorem title="Chinese Remainder Theorem for rings" number="4.7">
Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $I, J$ be ideals with $I + J = R$ (the ideals are **coprime**). Then:

$$R/(I \cap J) \cong R/I \times R/J$$

More generally, if $I_1, \ldots, I_n$ are pairwise coprime ideals ($I_i + I_j = R$ for $i \neq j$), then

$$R/(I_1 \cap \cdots \cap I_n) \cong R/I_1 \times \cdots \times R/I_n$$
</Theorem>

<Example id="CRT-example" title="Chinese Remainder Theorem for integers">
Since $(2) + (3) = (1) = \mathbb{Z}$, we get $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$. More generally, $\mathbb{Z}/mn\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ when $\gcd(m, n) = 1$.
</Example>

## The Nilradical and Jacobson Radical

<Definition title="Nilradical" number="4.15">
The **nilradical** of a commutative ring $R$ is

$$\mathrm{nil}(R) = \sqrt{(0)} = \{r \in R : r^n = 0 \text{ for some } n \geq 1\}$$

An element $r$ with $r^n = 0$ is called **nilpotent**. A ring with $\mathrm{nil}(R) = 0$ is called **reduced**.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Jacobson radical" number="4.16">
The **Jacobson radical** of a commutative ring $R$ is

$$\mathrm{Jac}(R) = \bigcap_{\mathfrak{m} \text{ maximal}} \mathfrak{m}$$

It consists of elements $r$ such that $1 - rx$ is a unit for all $x \in R$.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Nilradical as intersection of primes" number="4.8">
For a commutative ring $R$, the nilradical equals the intersection of all prime ideals:

$$\mathrm{nil}(R) = \bigcap_{\mathfrak{p} \text{ prime}} \mathfrak{p}$$
</Theorem>

<Example id="nilradical-example" title="Nilradicals in quotient rings">
- $\mathrm{nil}(\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}) = (6)/(12) = \{\bar{0}, \bar{6}\}$, since $\bar{6}^2 = \bar{36} = \bar{0}$.
- $\mathrm{nil}(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}) = (p)/(p^n) = \{\bar{0}, \bar{p}, \bar{2p}, \ldots\}$.
- $\mathrm{nil}(\mathbb{Z}) = (0)$, so $\mathbb{Z}$ is reduced.
</Example>

## Existence of Maximal Ideals

<Theorem title="Existence of maximal ideals" number="4.9">
Every nonzero ring $R$ contains at least one maximal ideal.
</Theorem>

<Remark title="Zorn's lemma is needed">
The proof of this theorem requires Zorn's lemma (equivalently, the Axiom of Choice). Given a proper ideal $I \subset R$, consider the poset of all proper ideals containing $I$, ordered by inclusion. Every chain has an upper bound (its union, which is proper since it does not contain $1$). By Zorn's lemma, this poset has a maximal element, which is a maximal ideal containing $I$.
</Remark>

<Example id="local-ring" title="Local rings">
A commutative ring with exactly one maximal ideal is called a **local ring**. Examples include:
- $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)} = \{a/b \in \mathbb{Q} : p \nmid b\}$, with maximal ideal $p\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$.
- $k[[x]]$ (formal power series), with maximal ideal $(x)$.
- $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ for prime $p$, with maximal ideal $(\bar{p})$.
</Example>

---

## Summary

<Remark title="Looking ahead">
The concepts of prime and maximal ideals become geometric in algebraic geometry:
- $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$, the set of all prime ideals of $R$, is the **spectrum** of $R$ and forms a topological space (with the Zariski topology). It is the fundamental object in scheme theory.
- The maximal ideals $\mathrm{mSpec}(R)$ correspond to "closed points" of this space.
- For $R = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ (a polynomial ring over an algebraically closed field), the maximal ideals correspond to points $(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in k^n$ by the Nullstellensatz.
</Remark>
