# PIDs and UFDs

Principal ideal domains and unique factorization domains are two of the most important classes of integral domains. They capture, at different levels of generality, the idea that elements can be factored into "primes" in an essentially unique way.

---

## Principal Ideal Domains

<Definition title="Principal ideal domain" number="4.22">
An integral domain $R$ is a **principal ideal domain (PID)** if every ideal of $R$ is principal, i.e., of the form $(a) = aR$ for some $a \in R$.
</Definition>

<Example id="pid-examples" title="Examples of PIDs">
- $\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID: every ideal is of the form $n\mathbb{Z}$.
- For any field $F$, $F[x]$ is a PID (proven via the division algorithm).
- $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (Gaussian integers) is a PID (proven via the norm function).
- $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ (Eisenstein integers) is a PID.
</Example>

<Example id="non-pid" title="Non-examples of PIDs">
- $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is NOT a PID: the ideal $(2, x)$ is not principal. If $(2, x) = (f)$, then $f \mid 2$ and $f \mid x$. From $f \mid 2$, either $f = \pm 1$ (giving $(f) = \mathbb{Z}[x]$) or $f = \pm 2$ (but then $f \nmid x$). So $(2, x)$ is not principal.
- $k[x, y]$ for a field $k$ is NOT a PID: $(x, y)$ is not principal.
- $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is NOT a PID: the ideal $(2, 1 + \sqrt{-5})$ is not principal.
</Example>

<Theorem title="Properties of PIDs" number="4.16">
Let $R$ be a PID. Then:

1. Every nonzero prime ideal is maximal.
2. $R$ is a Noetherian ring (every ideal is finitely generated, in fact generated by one element).
3. $R$ is a UFD (see below).
</Theorem>

<Example id="pid-primes-maximal" title="Primes are maximal in PIDs">
In $\mathbb{Z}$, the nonzero prime ideals are $(p)$ for prime $p$, and these are all maximal.

In $F[x]$ for a field $F$, the nonzero prime ideals are $(f)$ for irreducible $f$, and these are all maximal. This means $F[x]/(f)$ is a field whenever $f$ is irreducible.

Contrast with $\mathbb{Z}[x]$: $(x)$ is prime (since $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ is an integral domain) but not maximal (since $\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field).
</Example>

## Euclidean Domains

<Definition title="Euclidean domain" number="4.23">
An integral domain $R$ is a **Euclidean domain** if there exists a function $N: R \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ (called a **Euclidean function** or **norm**) such that for all $a, b \in R$ with $b \neq 0$, there exist $q, r \in R$ with

$$a = bq + r \quad \text{and} \quad (r = 0 \text{ or } N(r) < N(b))$$
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Euclidean domains are PIDs" number="4.17">
Every Euclidean domain is a PID.
</Theorem>

<Example id="euclidean-examples" title="Examples of Euclidean domains">
- $\mathbb{Z}$ with $N(a) = |a|$.
- $F[x]$ for a field $F$ with $N(f) = \deg(f)$.
- $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ with $N(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2$.
- $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ with $N(a + b\omega) = a^2 - ab + b^2$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$.
- Any field $F$ (trivially, with $N(a) = 0$ for all $a \neq 0$).
</Example>

<Example id="pid-not-euclidean" title="A PID that is not Euclidean">
The ring $\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1 + \sqrt{-19}}{2}\right]$ is a PID but not a Euclidean domain. This was proved by Motzkin (1949). The proof is nontrivial and shows that the implication Euclidean $\Rightarrow$ PID is strict.
</Example>

## Unique Factorization Domains

<Definition title="Irreducible and prime elements" number="4.24">
Let $R$ be an integral domain. A nonzero non-unit element $p \in R$ is:

- **Irreducible** if $p = ab$ implies $a$ is a unit or $b$ is a unit.
- **Prime** if $p \mid ab$ implies $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$.

Two elements $a, b \in R$ are **associates** if $a = ub$ for some unit $u \in R^\times$.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Prime implies irreducible" number="4.18">
In an integral domain, every prime element is irreducible. The converse holds in UFDs but not in general.
</Theorem>

<Example id="irreducible-not-prime" title="Irreducible but not prime">
In $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, the element $2$ is irreducible (check via the norm $N(a + b\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2$: if $2 = \alpha\beta$, then $4 = N(\alpha)N(\beta)$, and $N(\alpha) \neq 2$ for any $\alpha$). However, $2$ is NOT prime: $2 \mid (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5}) = 6$ but $2 \nmid (1 + \sqrt{-5})$ and $2 \nmid (1 - \sqrt{-5})$.

Wait: $2 \mid 6$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ means $6/2 = 3 \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, so $2 \mid 6$. But actually $(1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5}) = 1 + 5 = 6 = 2 \cdot 3$. We have $2 \mid (1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})$ but $2 \nmid (1+\sqrt{-5})$ and $2 \nmid (1-\sqrt{-5})$ in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$.
</Example>

<Definition title="Unique factorization domain" number="4.25">
An integral domain $R$ is a **unique factorization domain (UFD)** if:

1. **Existence**: Every nonzero non-unit element $a \in R$ can be written as a product of irreducibles: $a = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n$.
2. **Uniqueness**: If $a = p_1 \cdots p_n = q_1 \cdots q_m$ are two factorizations into irreducibles, then $n = m$ and (after reordering) $p_i$ and $q_i$ are associates for all $i$.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Equivalent characterization of UFDs" number="4.19">
An integral domain $R$ is a UFD if and only if:

1. Every nonzero non-unit element is a product of irreducibles, and
2. Every irreducible element is prime.
</Theorem>

## Examples and Non-examples

<Example id="Z-ufd" title="The integers are a UFD">
$\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. The irreducible elements are the primes $\pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 5, \ldots$ and the units are $\pm 1$. For example, $60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$ is the unique factorization (up to order and signs).
</Example>

<Example id="Fx-ufd" title="Polynomial rings over fields are UFDs">
$F[x]$ for a field $F$ is a UFD (since it is a PID). The irreducible elements are the irreducible polynomials.

$F[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ for a field $F$ is a UFD (by repeated application of Gauss's lemma and the Hilbert Basis Theorem, or by direct proof). However, it is NOT a PID for $n \geq 2$.
</Example>

<Example id="Z-sqrt-5" title="Failure of unique factorization">
$\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is NOT a UFD. We have two distinct factorizations:

$$6 = 2 \cdot 3 = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5})$$

All four factors $2, 3, 1 + \sqrt{-5}, 1 - \sqrt{-5}$ are irreducible (verifiable via the norm), and no two are associates. So $6$ has two genuinely different factorizations into irreducibles.
</Example>

<Example id="Z-sqrt-d" title="Quadratic integer rings">
For a squarefree integer $d$:
- $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ is a UFD for $d = -1, -2, -3, -7, -11$ (and finitely many other negative $d$).
- $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ is NOT a UFD for $d = -5, -6, -10, -13, \ldots$
- For positive $d$: $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}], \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{3}], \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{5}]$ are UFDs, but $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{10}]$ is not.

The class number $h(d)$ measures how far $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ (or its ring of integers) is from being a UFD: it is a UFD iff $h(d) = 1$.
</Example>

---

## GCD in UFDs

<Definition title="Greatest common divisor" number="4.26">
In a UFD $R$, the **greatest common divisor** of nonzero elements $a, b \in R$ is an element $d \in R$ such that:

1. $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$.
2. If $c \mid a$ and $c \mid b$, then $c \mid d$.

The GCD exists and is unique up to associates. We write $d = \gcd(a, b)$.
</Definition>

<Example id="gcd-polynomial" title="GCD of polynomials">
In $\mathbb{Q}[x]$:

$$\gcd(x^3 - 1, x^2 - 1) = x - 1$$

since $x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)$ and $x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)$.

Over $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ (a PID), the GCD can be computed by the Euclidean algorithm.
</Example>

<Remark title="GCD in PIDs vs UFDs">
In a PID, $\gcd(a, b) = d$ can be expressed as a linear combination: $d = ra + sb$ for some $r, s \in R$ (Bezout's identity). In a general UFD, Bezout's identity does NOT hold. For example, in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$:

$$\gcd(2, x) = 1, \quad \text{but } 1 \neq 2f(x) + xg(x) \text{ for any } f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$$

(The constant term of $2f(x) + xg(x)$ is $2f(0)$, which is always even.)
</Remark>

## The Hierarchy

<Theorem title="Hierarchy of integral domains" number="4.20">
The following implications hold for integral domains:

$$\text{Field} \Rightarrow \text{Euclidean Domain} \Rightarrow \text{PID} \Rightarrow \text{UFD} \Rightarrow \text{Integral Domain}$$

Each implication is strict (none is reversible).
</Theorem>

<Example id="hierarchy-examples" title="Witnessing each strict implication">
- **Field but not just ED**: Every field is trivially a Euclidean domain.
- **ED but not Field**: $\mathbb{Z}$ is a Euclidean domain but not a field.
- **PID but not ED**: $\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{-19}}{2}\right]$ is a PID but not a Euclidean domain.
- **UFD but not PID**: $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a UFD (since $\mathbb{Z}$ is a UFD) but not a PID (the ideal $(2, x)$ is not principal).
- **Integral domain but not UFD**: $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ is an integral domain but not a UFD.
</Example>

## Connection to Algebraic Number Theory

<Remark title="Ideal class group">
When a number ring $\mathcal{O}_K$ (the ring of integers of a number field $K$) fails to be a UFD, Kummer and Dedekind discovered that unique factorization can be recovered at the level of **ideals**: every nonzero ideal of $\mathcal{O}_K$ factors uniquely as a product of prime ideals. The **ideal class group** $\mathrm{Cl}(K)$ measures the failure of $\mathcal{O}_K$ to be a PID: $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a PID if and only if $\mathrm{Cl}(K)$ is trivial.

For example, $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$ has class number $2$. The ideal $(2, 1 + \sqrt{-5})$ is not principal, but its square $(2, 1+\sqrt{-5})^2 = (2)$ is principal.
</Remark>

<Example id="dedekind-domain" title="Dedekind domains">
A **Dedekind domain** is an integral domain in which every nonzero ideal factors uniquely into prime ideals. Examples:
- Every PID is a Dedekind domain.
- The ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ of any number field $K$.
- $k[C]$ where $C$ is a nonsingular algebraic curve over a field $k$.

A Dedekind domain is a UFD if and only if it is a PID.
</Example>

## Summary

<Remark title="Key takeaways">
The notions of PID and UFD capture two different aspects of "nice" factorization:

- **PID**: Every ideal is generated by a single element. This is a strong structural condition that implies, among other things, that the ring is Noetherian and that every irreducible element is prime.

- **UFD**: Elements factor uniquely into irreducibles. This is a weaker condition that allows ideals to require multiple generators (like $(2, x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$) but still ensures that arithmetic works well.

Both concepts are essential for understanding polynomial rings, number rings, and their applications in algebraic geometry and number theory.
