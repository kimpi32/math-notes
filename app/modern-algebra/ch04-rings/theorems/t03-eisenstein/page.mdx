# Eisenstein's Criterion

Eisenstein's criterion is one of the most powerful and frequently used tests for irreducibility of polynomials over the integers (and hence over the rationals). It reduces the problem of irreducibility to a simple divisibility check on the coefficients.

---

## Statement

<Theorem title="Eisenstein's Criterion" number="4.38">
Let $f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $n \geq 1$. Suppose there exists a prime $p$ such that:

1. $p \nmid a_n$ (the leading coefficient is not divisible by $p$).
2. $p \mid a_i$ for all $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ (all other coefficients are divisible by $p$).
3. $p^2 \nmid a_0$ (the constant term is not divisible by $p^2$).

Then $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.
</Theorem>

<Remark title="Irreducibility over integers vs rationals">
By Gauss's lemma, if $f$ is primitive (the GCD of its coefficients is $1$), then $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}$ if and only if it is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. The Eisenstein criterion, combined with Gauss's lemma, gives irreducibility over both $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ for primitive polynomials.
</Remark>

## Proof

<Proof>
Suppose for contradiction that $f = gh$ in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $\deg(g) \geq 1$ and $\deg(h) \geq 1$. Write:

$$g(x) = b_r x^r + \cdots + b_1 x + b_0, \quad h(x) = c_s x^s + \cdots + c_1 x + c_0$$

where $r + s = n$, $r \geq 1$, $s \geq 1$.

**Step 1**: Since $a_0 = b_0 c_0$ and $p \mid a_0$ but $p^2 \nmid a_0$, exactly one of $b_0, c_0$ is divisible by $p$. Say $p \mid b_0$ and $p \nmid c_0$.

**Step 2**: Since $a_n = b_r c_s$ and $p \nmid a_n$, we have $p \nmid b_r$.

**Step 3**: Since $p \mid b_0$ and $p \nmid b_r$, there is a smallest index $k$ with $1 \leq k \leq r$ such that $p \nmid b_k$. So $p \mid b_0, p \mid b_1, \ldots, p \mid b_{k-1}$, but $p \nmid b_k$.

**Step 4**: Consider the coefficient $a_k = b_k c_0 + b_{k-1} c_1 + \cdots + b_0 c_k$. Since $k \leq r < n$, we have $p \mid a_k$ by hypothesis (2). All terms $b_j c_{k-j}$ with $j < k$ have $p \mid b_j$, so $p \mid (b_{k-1}c_1 + \cdots + b_0 c_k)$. Therefore $p \mid b_k c_0$, and since $p \nmid c_0$, we get $p \mid b_k$. This contradicts the choice of $k$.
</Proof>

## Classical Examples

<Example id="eisenstein-cyclotomic" title="Cyclotomic polynomials">
The $p$-th cyclotomic polynomial for a prime $p$ is

$$\Phi_p(x) = \frac{x^p - 1}{x - 1} = x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + \cdots + x + 1$$

To show $\Phi_p$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, substitute $x = y + 1$:

$$\Phi_p(y + 1) = \frac{(y+1)^p - 1}{y} = y^{p-1} + \binom{p}{1}y^{p-2} + \binom{p}{2}y^{p-3} + \cdots + \binom{p}{p-1}$$

Since $p \mid \binom{p}{k}$ for $1 \leq k \leq p-1$ and $\binom{p}{p-1} = p$ (so $p^2 \nmid p$), the Eisenstein criterion with prime $p$ applies to $\Phi_p(y+1)$. Since $\Phi_p(y+1)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, so is $\Phi_p(x)$.
</Example>

<Example id="eisenstein-basic" title="Simple applications">
- $f(x) = x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + 3$: Take $p = 3$. Then $3 \nmid 1$ (leading), $3 \mid 6, 3 \mid 9, 3 \mid 3$, and $9 \nmid 3$. So $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.

- $f(x) = x^4 + 10x^3 + 15x^2 + 20x + 5$: Take $p = 5$. Then $5 \nmid 1$, $5 \mid 10, 5 \mid 15, 5 \mid 20, 5 \mid 5$, and $25 \nmid 5$. Irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.

- $f(x) = 2x^5 + 6x^3 + 9x + 3$: Take $p = 3$. Then $3 \nmid 2$, $3 \mid 6, 3 \mid 9, 3 \mid 3$, and $9 \nmid 3$. Irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$.
</Example>

<Example id="eisenstein-fails" title="When Eisenstein does not apply directly">
$f(x) = x^4 + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ but no prime $p$ satisfies Eisenstein's conditions for $f$ directly (the leading coefficient is $1$, the constant term is $1$, and $p \mid 1$ is impossible).

However, substituting $x = y + 1$:

$$f(y+1) = (y+1)^4 + 1 = y^4 + 4y^3 + 6y^2 + 4y + 2$$

Now Eisenstein applies with $p = 2$: $2 \nmid 1$, $2 \mid 4, 2 \mid 6, 2 \mid 4, 2 \mid 2$, and $4 \nmid 2$. So $f(y+1)$ is irreducible, hence $f(x)$ is irreducible.
</Example>

<Example id="eisenstein-sqrt" title="Irreducibility of minimal polynomials">
The minimal polynomial of $\sqrt[n]{p}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^n - p$ for any prime $p$ and $n \geq 2$. Eisenstein applies directly with the prime $p$: $p \nmid 1$ (leading), $p \mid (-p)$ is just $p \mid p$... wait, more carefully: $f(x) = x^n - p$ has $a_n = 1, a_{n-1} = \cdots = a_1 = 0, a_0 = -p$. Then $p \nmid 1$, $p \mid 0$ (for all middle coefficients), $p \mid (-p)$, and $p^2 \nmid (-p)$. So $x^n - p$ is irreducible.

This proves $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{p}) : \mathbb{Q}] = n$.
</Example>

## Generalized Eisenstein Criterion

<Theorem title="Eisenstein's Criterion over UFDs" number="4.39">
Let $R$ be a UFD with fraction field $K$, and let $f(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_0 \in R[x]$ be primitive with $n \geq 1$. If there exists an irreducible $p \in R$ such that:

1. $p \nmid a_n$.
2. $p \mid a_i$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$.
3. $p^2 \nmid a_0$.

Then $f$ is irreducible over $K$ (and over $R$).
</Theorem>

<Example id="eisenstein-Zx" title="Eisenstein over polynomial rings">
In $\mathbb{Z}[t][x]$, consider $f(x) = x^3 + t^2 x + t \in \mathbb{Z}[t][x]$. Take the irreducible element $p = t \in \mathbb{Z}[t]$. Then: $t \nmid 1$ (leading coefficient), $t \mid t^2$ and $t \mid t$, and $t^2 \nmid t$. So $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$.
</Example>

<Example id="eisenstein-p-adic" title="Eisenstein polynomials and p-adic fields">
An **Eisenstein polynomial** over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (the $p$-adic integers) is a monic polynomial $f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0$ with $p \mid a_i$ for all $i$ and $p^2 \nmid a_0$. Such polynomials are always irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and the extension $\mathbb{Q}_p[x]/(f)$ is a totally ramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of degree $n$.

For example, $x^3 + p$ is an Eisenstein polynomial giving a totally ramified cubic extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$.
</Example>

## Limitations

<Example id="eisenstein-limitation-1" title="Irreducible but not Eisenstein">
$f(x) = x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ (it has no rational roots), but no prime works for Eisenstein: the leading and constant coefficients are both $1$, and no prime divides $1$.

However, $f(y+1) = y^2 + 3y + 3$ satisfies Eisenstein with $p = 3$.
</Example>

<Example id="eisenstein-limitation-2" title="No substitution helps">
Some irreducible polynomials cannot be shown irreducible by Eisenstein, even after any substitution $x \mapsto x + c$. For example, $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = \Phi_5(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, but to use Eisenstein one needs a more clever substitution (here $x \mapsto x + 1$ works for $\Phi_p$ by the cyclotomic argument).

More seriously, $x^4 + 6x^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ (it has no rational roots and is not a product of two quadratics in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$), but no substitution $x \mapsto x + c$ makes it Eisenstein for any prime.
</Example>

<Example id="reducible-looks-eisenstein" title="The converse is false">
The converse of Eisenstein's criterion is false: there exist reducible polynomials where conditions (1) and (2) hold but (3) fails. For instance, $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 4$ with $p = 2$: $2 \nmid 1$, $2 \mid 2$, $2 \mid 4$, but $4 \mid 4$. Indeed, over $\mathbb{Q}$, $f = (x + 1 + \sqrt{-3})(x + 1 - \sqrt{-3})$ is irreducible, but condition (3) was still violated. The point is condition (3) is essential: $x^2 + 4$ with $p = 2$ fails condition (3), and while $x^2 + 4$ happens to be irreducible, the polynomial $x^2 - 4 = (x-2)(x+2)$ also fails condition (3) and IS reducible.
</Example>

## Eisenstein and Algebraic Number Theory

<Example id="number-field-application" title="Generating number fields">
To construct a number field of degree $n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, one common approach is to find an Eisenstein polynomial:

- $x^2 - 2$: Eisenstein at $p = 2$, gives $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$.
- $x^3 - 2$: Eisenstein at $p = 2$, gives $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$.
- $x^5 - 7$: Eisenstein at $p = 7$, gives $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[5]{7})$.
- $x^4 + 4x^2 + 2$: Eisenstein at $p = 2$, gives a degree-4 number field.

The Eisenstein condition at $p$ implies that $p$ is **totally ramified** in the resulting number field extension.
</Example>

<Example id="eisenstein-degree-two" title="Eisenstein for quadratics">
$f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 2$: Eisenstein at $p = 2$ gives $2 \nmid 1$, $2 \mid 2$, $2 \mid 2$, $4 \nmid 2$. So $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. Note that $f = (x+1)^2 + 1$, so its roots are $-1 \pm i$, confirming irreducibility over $\mathbb{R}$.
</Example>

<Example id="eisenstein-high-degree" title="Eisenstein for higher degrees">
$f(x) = x^{p-1} - p$ for a prime $p$: Eisenstein at $p$ gives $p \nmid 1$ (leading), $p \mid 0$ (middle coefficients, which are all zero), $p \mid (-p)$, and $p^2 \nmid (-p)$. So $x^{p-1} - p$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ for every prime $p$.
</Example>

## Summary

<Remark title="When to use Eisenstein's criterion">
Eisenstein's criterion is the first tool to try when testing irreducibility of a polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$:

1. Check if any prime $p$ divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $p^2$ does not divide the constant term.
2. If no prime works directly, try substitutions $x \mapsto x + a$ for small values of $a$.
3. If that fails, try other methods: the rational root theorem, reduction modulo $p$, or the theory of Newton polygons.

Eisenstein is "global" in nature (it uses a single prime that controls all coefficients), while reduction mod $p$ is "local" (it works one prime at a time). Both are consequences of Gauss's lemma.
