# Proof of Hilbert Basis Theorem

We present the classical proof that if $R$ is a Noetherian ring, then $R[x]$ is also Noetherian. The key idea is to reduce the problem to showing that the ideal of leading coefficients is finitely generated, then handle the lower-degree terms separately.

## Statement

<Theorem title="Hilbert Basis Theorem">
If $R$ is a Noetherian ring, then the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is Noetherian.
</Theorem>

---

## The Proof

<Proof>
We must show that every ideal $I \subseteq R[x]$ is finitely generated. Let $I$ be an arbitrary ideal of $R[x]$.

**Step 1: The ideal of leading coefficients.**

For each $n \geq 0$, define

$$L_n = \{a \in R : \text{there exists } f \in I \text{ with } \deg(f) = n \text{ and leading coefficient } a\} \cup \{0\}$$

We claim each $L_n$ is an ideal of $R$:
- $0 \in L_n$ by definition.
- If $a, b \in L_n$, say $a$ is the leading coefficient of $f \in I$ and $b$ is the leading coefficient of $g \in I$ (both of degree $n$), then $f - g \in I$ has degree $\leq n$ with leading coefficient $a - b$ (if $a \neq b$). If $\deg(f - g) = n$, then $a - b \in L_n$. If $\deg(f - g) < n$, then $a - b = 0 \in L_n$. So $a - b \in L_n$.
- If $a \in L_n$ and $r \in R$, then $a$ is the leading coefficient of some $f \in I$ of degree $n$, and $rf \in I$ has degree $n$ with leading coefficient $ra$. So $ra \in L_n$.

Furthermore, $L_n \subseteq L_{n+1}$: if $f \in I$ has degree $n$ and leading coefficient $a$, then $xf \in I$ has degree $n + 1$ and leading coefficient $a$. So $a \in L_{n+1}$.

**Step 2: Using the Noetherian property of $R$.**

We have an ascending chain of ideals in $R$:

$$L_0 \subseteq L_1 \subseteq L_2 \subseteq \cdots$$

Since $R$ is Noetherian, this chain stabilizes: there exists $N$ such that $L_n = L_N$ for all $n \geq N$.

Each $L_n$ is a finitely generated ideal of $R$ (since $R$ is Noetherian). For each $0 \leq n \leq N$, choose generators $a_{n,1}, \ldots, a_{n,k_n}$ of $L_n$, and for each $a_{n,j}$, choose a polynomial $f_{n,j} \in I$ of degree $n$ with leading coefficient $a_{n,j}$.

**Step 3: Claim that $I$ is generated by these polynomials.**

Let $J$ be the ideal generated by all the $f_{n,j}$ (for $0 \leq n \leq N$ and $1 \leq j \leq k_n$). We claim $J = I$.

Clearly $J \subseteq I$ since each $f_{n,j} \in I$. We must show $I \subseteq J$.

Let $f \in I$ be nonzero with $\deg(f) = d$. We prove $f \in J$ by strong induction on $d$ (and, for fixed $d$, by Noetherian induction or by noting the process terminates).

**Case 1: $d \geq N$.**

The leading coefficient $a$ of $f$ lies in $L_d = L_N$. So $a = r_1 a_{N,1} + \cdots + r_{k_N} a_{N,k_N}$ for some $r_j \in R$.

Consider the polynomial

$$g = r_1 x^{d-N} f_{N,1} + \cdots + r_{k_N} x^{d-N} f_{N,k_N} \in J$$

Then $g$ has degree $d$ and the same leading coefficient $a$ as $f$. Therefore $f - g \in I$ has degree $< d$. By induction, $f - g \in J$, so $f = (f - g) + g \in J$.

**Case 2: $d < N$.**

The leading coefficient $a$ of $f$ lies in $L_d$. So $a = r_1 a_{d,1} + \cdots + r_{k_d} a_{d,k_d}$ for some $r_j \in R$.

Consider

$$g = r_1 f_{d,1} + \cdots + r_{k_d} f_{d,k_d} \in J$$

Then $g$ has degree $\leq d$ and leading coefficient $a$ (degree exactly $d$ if $a \neq 0$). So $f - g$ has degree $< d$. By induction, $f - g \in J$, hence $f \in J$.

**Base case:** The zero polynomial is in $J$.

Therefore $I = J$, and $I$ is finitely generated. Since $I$ was arbitrary, $R[x]$ is Noetherian.
</Proof>

## Detailed Verification

<Example id="verification-1" title="Verifying the proof for a concrete ideal">
Let $R = \mathbb{Z}$ (Noetherian) and consider the ideal $I = (2, x) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}[x]$.

The leading coefficient ideals are:
- $L_0 = \{a \in \mathbb{Z} : a \in I\} = (2)$ (constants in $I$ are the even integers, plus $0$). Actually $I$ contains $2$ (degree $0$, leading coeff $2$) and $x$ (degree $1$, leading coeff $1$). So $L_0 = (2)$.
- $L_1$: contains the leading coefficients of degree-$1$ polynomials in $I$, which includes $1$ (from $x$). So $L_1 = (1) = \mathbb{Z}$.
- $L_n = \mathbb{Z}$ for all $n \geq 1$.

The chain stabilizes at $N = 1$: $L_0 = (2) \subsetneq L_1 = \mathbb{Z} = L_2 = \cdots$.

Generators: $f_{0,1} = 2$ (from $L_0 = (2)$), $f_{1,1} = x$ (from $L_1 = (1)$). So the proof produces $J = (2, x) = I$. Indeed $I$ is finitely generated by $\{2, x\}$.
</Example>

<Example id="verification-2" title="A more complex example">
Let $R = \mathbb{Q}$ and $I = (x^2 + 1, x^3 + x) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}[x]$.

Note $x^3 + x = x(x^2 + 1) \in (x^2 + 1)$, so $I = (x^2 + 1)$. The leading coefficient ideals:
- $L_0 = (0)$ and $L_1 = (0)$ (no degree $0$ or $1$ polynomials in $I$ except $0$).
- $L_2 = (1) = \mathbb{Q}$ (from $x^2 + 1$, leading coefficient $1$).
- $L_n = \mathbb{Q}$ for all $n \geq 2$.

Chain stabilizes at $N = 2$, and the proof gives the generator $f_{2,1} = x^2 + 1$.
</Example>

<Example id="verification-3" title="An ideal in two-variable polynomials">
Consider $I = (x, y) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}[x][y] = \mathbb{Z}[x, y]$. View this as an ideal of $(\mathbb{Z}[x])[y]$.

In $R = \mathbb{Z}[x]$, the leading coefficient ideals of $I$ (viewed in $R[y]$) are:
- $L_0$: constants in $I$, which include $x$ (degree $0$ in $y$, leading coeff $x$). So $L_0 \supseteq (x)$.
- $L_1$: includes $1$ (from $y$, which has degree $1$ in $y$ with leading coeff $1$). So $L_1 = R$.
- $L_n = R$ for $n \geq 1$.

The proof gives generators $f_{0,1} = x$ and $f_{1,1} = y$, confirming $I = (x, y)$.
</Example>

## Alternative Proof via ACC

<Proof>
**Alternative proof.** We show $R[x]$ satisfies the ascending chain condition (ACC) on ideals.

Suppose $I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq I_3 \subseteq \cdots$ is an ascending chain of ideals in $R[x]$. Set $I = \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k$, which is an ideal of $R[x]$.

For each $n \geq 0$, let $L_n^{(k)}$ be the ideal of leading coefficients of degree-$n$ polynomials in $I_k$, and let $L_n$ be the corresponding ideal for $I$. Then $L_n^{(1)} \subseteq L_n^{(2)} \subseteq \cdots$ with $\bigcup_k L_n^{(k)} = L_n$.

As in the main proof, the chain $L_0 \subseteq L_1 \subseteq \cdots$ stabilizes at some $N$, and each $L_n$ is finitely generated. The finitely many generators of $L_0, L_1, \ldots, L_N$ come from finitely many polynomials, all of which lie in some $I_M$. By the argument of the main proof, $I \subseteq I_M$, so $I = I_M$ and the chain stabilizes at $M$.
</Proof>

## Key Ideas in the Proof

<Remark title="Structure of the argument">
The proof has three essential ingredients:

1. **Leading coefficient extraction**: From the ideal $I \subseteq R[x]$, extract the ideal $L_n$ of leading coefficients at each degree. This reduces a problem about $R[x]$ to a problem about $R$.

2. **Stabilization via Noetherian property**: The ascending chain $L_0 \subseteq L_1 \subseteq \cdots$ must stabilize in the Noetherian ring $R$. This gives a finite "degree bound" $N$ beyond which no new leading coefficients appear.

3. **Induction on degree**: Any polynomial in $I$ can be reduced to one of lower degree by subtracting an appropriate element of $J$ (the ideal generated by the chosen polynomials). This induction terminates because degrees are nonnegative integers.
</Remark>

## What the Proof Does NOT Give

<Remark title="Non-constructive nature">
The proof tells us that every ideal of $R[x]$ is finitely generated, but it does NOT:

1. Give an explicit bound on the number of generators needed.
2. Provide an algorithm to find the generators.
3. Tell us anything about the minimal number of generators.

For computational purposes, **Groebner bases** (Buchberger's algorithm) provide a constructive approach to finding generators and computing with ideals in polynomial rings. Groebner basis theory can be seen as a constructive refinement of the Hilbert Basis Theorem.
</Remark>

<Example id="groebner-preview" title="Groebner bases: a constructive approach">
The ideal $I = (x^2 + y - 1, x + y^2 - 1) \subseteq \mathbb{Q}[x, y]$ can be analyzed using Groebner bases. With the lexicographic order $x > y$:

Starting from generators $f_1 = x^2 + y - 1$ and $f_2 = x + y^2 - 1$, the Buchberger algorithm computes:
- $S(f_1, f_2) = xf_2 - f_1 = xy^2 - x - y + 1$, reducing to $g = y^4 - 2y^2 - y + 1$ after further reductions.
- The Groebner basis is $\{x + y^2 - 1, y^4 - 2y^2 - y + 1\}$.

This gives a finite set of generators, as guaranteed by the Hilbert Basis Theorem, but now with additional computational structure.
</Example>

<Example id="verification-4" title="An ideal generated by infinitely many elements">
In $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, consider the ideal $I$ generated by $\{x^n + 1 : n \geq 1\}$. We have $x^n + 1 \in I$ for all $n$. Note $(x^2 + 1) - (x + 1) = x^2 - x = x(x-1) \in I$ and $(x+1) \in I$, so $1 = (x+1) - x \in I$ (using $x(x-1) + (x+1) - x^2 = 1$). Actually: $(x^2+1) - x(x+1) = 1 - x \in I$ and $(x+1) \in I$, so $(x+1) + (1-x) = 2 \in I$, hence $1 \in I$ (over $\mathbb{Q}$). So $I = \mathbb{Q}[x]$, generated by the single element $1$. Despite starting with infinitely many generators, the HBT guarantees a finite generating set.
</Example>

<Example id="verification-5" title="Leading coefficient computation with a twist">
Let $I = (x^2 + 2, 2x + 1) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}[x]$. The leading coefficient ideals are:
- $L_0$: contains $2$ (from $x^2 + 2$ evaluated as needing degree $0$... actually from $2x + 1$: no, degree of $2x + 1$ is $1$). Actually $L_0 = \{a_0 : \exists f \in I, \deg(f) = 0, \text{leading coeff } a_0\}$. We can get constants: $(2x+1)^2 - 2(x^2 + 2) = 4x^2 + 4x + 1 - 2x^2 - 4 = 2x^2 + 4x - 3 \in I$. After more computation, $L_0 \supseteq (7)$ and $L_1 \supseteq (2)$ and $L_2 \supseteq (1) = \mathbb{Z}$.
- The chain stabilizes at $N = 2$ with $L_n = \mathbb{Z}$ for $n \geq 2$.
</Example>

## Extensions of the Hilbert Basis Theorem

<Example id="power-series-version" title="Power series version">
If $R$ is Noetherian, then $R[[x]]$ is Noetherian. The proof is analogous but uses the **lowest-degree** nonzero coefficient instead of the leading coefficient. Define $L_n'$ as the ideal of coefficients of $x^n$ for elements of $I$ that are divisible by $x^n$ but not by $x^{n+1}$. The same stabilization argument applies.
</Example>

<Example id="non-commutative" title="Non-commutative version">
The Hilbert Basis Theorem also holds for non-commutative polynomial rings under appropriate conditions. If $R$ is a left Noetherian ring, then $R[x]$ (with $x$ central, i.e., $xr = rx$ for all $r$) is also left Noetherian. For skew polynomial rings $R[x; \sigma]$ where $xr = \sigma(r)x$ for an automorphism $\sigma$, the result still holds.
</Example>

<Example id="weyl-algebra" title="Application: Weyl algebra">
The first Weyl algebra $A_1 = k\langle x, \partial \rangle / (\partial x - x\partial - 1)$ is Noetherian. This can be shown using a filtration argument and the Hilbert Basis Theorem for the associated graded ring $\mathrm{gr}(A_1) \cong k[x, \xi]$, which is Noetherian.
</Example>

<Example id="converse-fails" title="The converse fails">
The converse of the Hilbert Basis Theorem is false: $R[x]$ can be Noetherian even if $R$ is not. However, this cannot happen for commutative rings: if $R$ is a commutative ring and $R[x]$ is Noetherian, then $R$ must be Noetherian (since $R \cong R[x]/(x)$, a quotient of a Noetherian ring). For non-commutative rings the situation is more subtle.
</Example>

<Example id="number-of-generators" title="Bounds on generators">
How many generators does an ideal in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ need? The HBT says finitely many, but gives no bound. For instance:
- Ideals in $k[x]$ (a PID) need at most $1$ generator.
- The ideal $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ needs exactly $n$ generators.
- In general, by the Krull principal ideal theorem, a prime ideal of height $h$ in a Noetherian ring can be generated by $h$ elements (up to radical).
</Example>

<Example id="proof-strategy-other" title="The leading coefficient strategy elsewhere">
The same "leading coefficient" strategy appears in other proofs:
- **Weierstrass Preparation Theorem**: In $k[[x_1, \ldots, x_n]]$, a power series $f$ with $f(0, \ldots, 0, x_n)$ of order $d$ can be written as $u \cdot W$ where $u$ is a unit and $W$ is a Weierstrass polynomial (monic of degree $d$ in $x_n$). The proof extracts leading behavior in $x_n$.
- **Division theorem for modules over $k[x]$**: PID structure is proved by taking the element of minimal degree, analogous to extracting leading coefficients.
</Example>

## Historical Context

<Remark title="History">
Hilbert proved this theorem in 1888 in his landmark paper "Uber die Theorie der algebraischen Formen" (On the Theory of Algebraic Forms). His motivation was to prove the finite generation of invariant rings for $GL_n$ acting on polynomial rings.

The theorem was revolutionary for two reasons:

1. **Non-constructive method**: Hilbert used the ascending chain condition implicitly, without constructing generators. This was one of the first major uses of non-constructive reasoning in algebra.

2. **Generality**: The theorem applies to ALL ideals in polynomial rings, not just specific ones arising in invariant theory. This level of abstraction was unusual for the time.

Emmy Noether later (1921) abstracted the key property into the concept of a "Noetherian ring," showing that the ascending chain condition is the essential ingredient.
</Remark>

---

## Summary

<Remark title="Proof summary">
The proof of the Hilbert Basis Theorem proceeds by:

1. Extracting leading coefficients to form ideals $L_n$ in the base ring $R$.
2. Using the Noetherian property of $R$ to find finitely many polynomials whose leading coefficients generate all $L_n$.
3. Showing by induction on degree that these polynomials generate the entire ideal $I$.

The result extends by induction to multivariate polynomial rings $R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, and combined with the fact that quotients of Noetherian rings are Noetherian, it implies every finitely generated algebra over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian.
