# p-Groups

A $p$-group is a group whose order is a power of a prime $p$. Despite this simple definition, $p$-groups have remarkably rich structure. The class equation shows that every nontrivial $p$-group has a nontrivial center, which is the starting point for understanding their internal structure via upper and lower central series. The Sylow theorems guarantee that every finite group contains $p$-subgroups of maximal order, making $p$-groups the essential building blocks of finite group theory.

## Definition and Basic Properties

<Definition title="p-group" number="3.18">
Let $p$ be a prime. A **$p$-group** is a group in which every element has order a power of $p$. For a finite group, this is equivalent to requiring that $|G| = p^n$ for some $n \geq 0$.

A **$p$-subgroup** of a group $G$ is a subgroup that is a $p$-group.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Nontrivial center of p-groups" number="3.5">
Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group with $|G| = p^n$ and $n \geq 1$. Then $Z(G) \neq \{e\}$. More precisely, $p$ divides $|Z(G)|$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
By the class equation: $|G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_{i=1}^{r} [G : C_G(a_i)]$ where the sum is over representatives of non-central conjugacy classes. Each $[G : C_G(a_i)]$ divides $|G| = p^n$ and is $> 1$, so each is divisible by $p$. Therefore $p$ divides $|G| - \sum [G : C_G(a_i)] = |Z(G)|$.
</Proof>

<Example id="p-groups-small" title="Small p-groups">
For $p = 2$:
- Order 2: $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ (only one group).
- Order 4: $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ (both abelian, confirming $p^2$-groups are abelian).
- Order 8: There are 5 groups: $\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^3$, $D_4$, $Q_8$.

For $p = 3$:
- Order 3: $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$.
- Order 9: $\mathbb{Z}/9\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$.
- Order 27: There are 5 groups.

The number of groups of order $p^n$ grows rapidly with $n$. There are 267 groups of order $2^6 = 64$.
</Example>

<Example id="p-group-z8" title="Center of the dihedral group D_4">
$D_4$ has order 8 = $2^3$, so it is a 2-group. Its center is $Z(D_4) = \{e, r^2\}$, which has order 2. Indeed, $|Z(D_4)| = 2$ divides $|D_4| = 8$, and it is nontrivial as guaranteed by the theorem.

The quotient $D_4/Z(D_4)$ has order 4, so it is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. Since $D_4/Z(D_4)$ is generated by the images of $r$ and $s$, both of order 2, we get $D_4/Z(D_4) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.
</Example>

## Structural Theorems for p-Groups

<Theorem title="Groups of order p^2 are abelian" number="3.6">
Every group of order $p^2$ is abelian. The two groups of order $p^2$ (up to isomorphism) are $\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
By the nontrivial center theorem, $|Z(G)| \in \{p, p^2\}$. If $|Z(G)| = p$, then $G/Z(G)$ has order $p$, hence is cyclic, say $G/Z(G) = \langle \bar{g} \rangle$. Every element of $G$ is of the form $g^k z$ for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $z \in Z(G)$. Then for any two elements $g^{k_1} z_1$ and $g^{k_2} z_2$: $(g^{k_1} z_1)(g^{k_2} z_2) = g^{k_1 + k_2} z_1 z_2 = (g^{k_2} z_2)(g^{k_1} z_1)$ since $z_1, z_2$ are central and $g^{k_1}, g^{k_2}$ commute with each other (they are powers of the same element). This makes $G$ abelian, contradicting $|Z(G)| = p < p^2 = |G|$.
</Proof>

<Theorem title="Existence of subgroups of all p-power orders" number="3.7">
Let $G$ be a $p$-group of order $p^n$. Then for every $0 \leq k \leq n$, $G$ has a subgroup of order $p^k$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
We proceed by induction on $n$. The case $n = 0$ is trivial. For $n \geq 1$, the center $Z(G)$ contains an element $z$ of order $p$ (by Cauchy's theorem applied to the abelian group $Z(G)$, or directly since $|Z(G)|$ is divisible by $p$). The subgroup $N = \langle z \rangle$ is normal (it lies in the center).

The quotient $G/N$ has order $p^{n-1}$, so by induction, it has subgroups of orders $1, p, p^2, \ldots, p^{n-1}$. By the correspondence theorem, these lift to subgroups of $G$ of orders $p, p^2, \ldots, p^n$.
</Proof>

<Example id="subgroups-z8" title="Subgroups of Z/8Z">
$G = \mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$ has order $2^3$. Its subgroups are:
- Order 1: $\{0\}$.
- Order 2: $\{0, 4\} = \langle 4 \rangle$.
- Order 4: $\{0, 2, 4, 6\} = \langle 2 \rangle$.
- Order 8: $G$ itself.

This confirms subgroups exist for every power of 2 dividing $|G|$.
</Example>

<Example id="subgroups-d4" title="Subgroups of D_4">
$D_4$ has order $2^3 = 8$. Its subgroups:
- Order 1: $\{e\}$.
- Order 2: $\langle s \rangle$, $\langle sr \rangle$, $\langle sr^2 \rangle$, $\langle sr^3 \rangle$, $\langle r^2 \rangle$ (five subgroups of order 2).
- Order 4: $\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$, $\{e, r^2, s, sr^2\} \cong V_4$, $\{e, r^2, sr, sr^3\} \cong V_4$ (three subgroups of order 4, all normal).
- Order 8: $D_4$ itself.

Every possible 2-power order occurs, and in fact there are more subgroups than the minimum required.
</Example>

## Normal Subgroups in p-Groups

<Theorem title="Normal subgroups of index p" number="3.8">
Every maximal subgroup of a finite $p$-group $G$ is normal and has index $p$. In particular, the number of maximal subgroups divides $|G/\Phi(G)| - 1$, where $\Phi(G)$ is the Frattini subgroup.
</Theorem>

<Example id="maximal-subgroups-q8" title="Maximal subgroups of Q_8">
$Q_8 = \{1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k\}$ has order 8 = $2^3$. The maximal subgroups are:
- $\langle i \rangle = \{1, -1, i, -i\} \cong \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$.
- $\langle j \rangle = \{1, -1, j, -j\} \cong \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$.
- $\langle k \rangle = \{1, -1, k, -k\} \cong \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$.

All three are normal (they are all of index 2), and each is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$. The Frattini subgroup is $\Phi(Q_8) = \{1, -1\}$, the intersection of all maximal subgroups.
</Example>

## p-Groups Acting on Sets

<Theorem title="Fixed point congruence for p-group actions" number="3.9">
Let $G$ be a $p$-group acting on a finite set $X$. Then

$$|X| \equiv |X^G| \pmod{p}$$

where $X^G = \{x \in X : g \cdot x = x \text{ for all } g \in G\}$ is the set of fixed points.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
Every orbit has size dividing $|G| = p^n$, so every orbit has size $p^k$ for some $0 \leq k \leq n$. An orbit has size 1 if and only if it consists of a fixed point. Hence

$$|X| = |X^G| + \sum |\mathcal{O}_i|$$

where the sum is over non-fixed-point orbits. Each $|\mathcal{O}_i|$ is divisible by $p$, so $|X| \equiv |X^G| \pmod{p}$.
</Proof>

<Example id="fixed-point-congruence-z3" title="Fixed point congruence: Z/3Z acting on subsets">
Let $G = \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} = \langle r \rangle$ act on the set of all subsets of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ by cyclic permutation $r: i \mapsto i + 2 \pmod{6}$ (so $r: 1 \mapsto 3 \mapsto 5 \mapsto 1$ and $2 \mapsto 4 \mapsto 6 \mapsto 2$).

$|X| = 2^6 = 64$. By the fixed point congruence, $|X^G| \equiv 64 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$.

A subset $S$ is fixed if and only if $r(S) = S$, meaning $S$ is a union of orbits of $r$ on $\{1,\ldots,6\}$. The orbits are $\{1,3,5\}$ and $\{2,4,6\}$, so a fixed subset is a union of some of these orbits: $\emptyset, \{1,3,5\}, \{2,4,6\}, \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Thus $|X^G| = 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$.
</Example>

<Example id="cauchy-theorem-via-action" title="Cauchy's theorem via p-group action">
**Cauchy's Theorem**: If $p$ divides $|G|$, then $G$ contains an element of order $p$.

**Proof using group actions**: Consider $X = \{(g_1, \ldots, g_p) \in G^p : g_1 g_2 \cdots g_p = e\}$. Then $|X| = |G|^{p-1}$ (choose $g_1, \ldots, g_{p-1}$ freely, and $g_p$ is determined).

The cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ acts on $X$ by cyclic rotation: $r \cdot (g_1, \ldots, g_p) = (g_2, \ldots, g_p, g_1)$. This is well-defined because $g_1 \cdots g_p = e$ implies $g_2 \cdots g_p g_1 = e$.

The fixed points are exactly the constant tuples $(g, g, \ldots, g)$ where $g^p = e$. By the congruence: $|X^G| \equiv |X| = |G|^{p-1} \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$.

Since the identity $(e, e, \ldots, e)$ is always a fixed point, we have $|X^G| \geq 1$, and since $p$ divides $|X^G|$, we get $|X^G| \geq p$. So there exists $g \neq e$ with $g^p = e$.
</Example>

<Example id="p-group-action-normalizer" title="p-group normalizer growth">
Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group and $H < G$ a proper subgroup. Then $H \subsetneq N_G(H)$ (the normalizer strictly contains $H$).

**Proof**: Let $G$ act on $G/H$ by left multiplication. The orbit of $eH$ has size $[G : H]$, which is a power of $p$ greater than 1. By the fixed point congruence applied to the $H$-action on $G/H$: $|G/H| \equiv |\text{fixed points of } H| \pmod{p}$.

Since $H$ fixes $eH$ (as $hH = H$ for $h \in H$), there is at least one fixed point. Since $p$ divides $[G:H]$, we get $p$ divides the number of fixed points, so there are at least $p$ fixed points. In particular, there exists $gH \neq eH$ with $hgH = gH$ for all $h \in H$, meaning $g^{-1}Hg \subseteq H$. Since $|g^{-1}Hg| = |H|$, we get $g^{-1}Hg = H$, so $g \in N_G(H) \setminus H$.
</Example>

## The Upper Central Series

<Definition title="Upper central series" number="3.19">
The **upper central series** of a group $G$ is the ascending chain

$$\{e\} = Z_0(G) \leq Z_1(G) \leq Z_2(G) \leq \cdots$$

where $Z_1(G) = Z(G)$ is the center, and $Z_{i+1}(G)/Z_i(G) = Z(G/Z_i(G))$ is defined by the property that $Z_{i+1}(G)$ is the preimage of the center of $G/Z_i(G)$.

A group $G$ is **nilpotent** if $Z_n(G) = G$ for some $n$. The smallest such $n$ is the **nilpotency class**.
</Definition>

<Example id="nilpotent-p-group" title="p-groups are nilpotent">
Every finite $p$-group is nilpotent. The proof proceeds inductively: $Z_1(G) = Z(G) \neq \{e\}$ by the nontrivial center theorem. The quotient $G/Z(G)$ is also a $p$-group (of smaller order), so by induction $G/Z(G)$ is nilpotent. Lifting the upper central series of $G/Z(G)$ back to $G$ shows $G$ is nilpotent.

For $D_4$ (order 8): $Z_0 = \{e\}$, $Z_1 = Z(D_4) = \{e, r^2\}$, and $D_4/Z_1 \cong V_4$ is abelian, so $Z_2 = D_4$. The nilpotency class is 2.

For $\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$: already abelian, so the nilpotency class is 1 (or 0 if trivial).
</Example>

## More Applications

<Example id="p-group-center-order-p3" title="Center of groups of order p^3">
Let $|G| = p^3$ with $G$ non-abelian. Then $|Z(G)| = p$ (not $p^2$ or $p^3$).

If $|Z(G)| = p^3$, then $G$ is abelian. If $|Z(G)| = p^2$, then $|G/Z(G)| = p$, so $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, implying $G$ is abelian, contradiction. So $|Z(G)| = p$.

Then $G/Z(G)$ has order $p^2$ and is abelian (since all groups of order $p^2$ are abelian). In fact, $G/Z(G) \cong \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ (it cannot be cyclic, or $G$ would be abelian).

For $p = 2$: $D_4$ and $Q_8$ are the two non-abelian groups of order 8, both with $|Z| = 2$.
</Example>

<Example id="p-group-automorphism" title="Automorphisms of p-groups">
For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ (order $p^2$), the automorphism group is $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ of order $(p^2 - 1)(p^2 - p) = p(p-1)^2(p+1)$.

For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$, $|\operatorname{Aut}(G)| = p^2 - p = p(p-1)$.

These automorphism groups play a role in classifying semidirect products involving $p$-groups.
</Example>

<Example id="p-group-frattini" title="Frattini subgroup of a p-group">
The **Frattini subgroup** $\Phi(G)$ is the intersection of all maximal subgroups of $G$. For a $p$-group $G$, $\Phi(G) = G^p [G, G]$ (the subgroup generated by $p$-th powers and commutators).

For $G = (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^n$: every element has order $p$, so $G^p = \{e\}$, and $[G,G] = \{e\}$ (abelian). The maximal subgroups are the $(n-1)$-dimensional subspaces. Their intersection is $\{0\}$, so $\Phi(G) = \{0\}$.

For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$: the unique maximal subgroup is $p\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, so $\Phi(G) = \langle p \rangle$.

The quotient $G/\Phi(G)$ is always an elementary abelian $p$-group. Its rank (the minimum number of generators of $G$) is $\dim_{\mathbb{F}_p}(G/\Phi(G))$.
</Example>

3. $p$-groups have subgroups of every possible $p$-power order (a "converse" to Lagrange).

4. The **fixed point congruence** $|X| \equiv |X^G| \pmod{p}$ is a fundamental tool.

5. Every $p$-group is **nilpotent**, with a well-defined upper central series.

6. The structure of $p$-groups underlies the **Sylow theorems** and much of finite group theory.
