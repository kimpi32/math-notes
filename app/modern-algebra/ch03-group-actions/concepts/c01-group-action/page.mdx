# Group Actions

A group action is a formal way of describing symmetries of a mathematical object. When a group $G$ "acts" on a set $X$, each element of $G$ corresponds to a permutation of $X$, and the group operation corresponds to composing these permutations. This concept unifies an enormous range of mathematical phenomena: rotational symmetry of geometric figures, permutation representations, conjugation within a group, and much more.

## Definition and Basic Properties

<Definition title="Group action (left action)" number="3.1">
Let $G$ be a group and $X$ a set. A **left action** of $G$ on $X$ is a function $\cdot : G \times X \to X$, written $(g, x) \mapsto g \cdot x$, satisfying:

1. **(Identity)** $e \cdot x = x$ for all $x \in X$, where $e$ is the identity of $G$.

2. **(Compatibility)** $(gh) \cdot x = g \cdot (h \cdot x)$ for all $g, h \in G$ and $x \in X$.

We say $G$ **acts on** $X$, or $X$ is a **$G$-set**.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Right action" number="3.2">
A **right action** of $G$ on $X$ is a function $X \times G \to X$, written $(x, g) \mapsto x \cdot g$, satisfying:

1. $x \cdot e = x$ for all $x \in X$.
2. $x \cdot (gh) = (x \cdot g) \cdot h$ for all $g, h \in G$ and $x \in X$.

Every left action gives a right action via $x \cdot g = g^{-1} \cdot x$, and vice versa. We will primarily work with left actions.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Equivalent formulation via homomorphisms" number="3.3">
A left action of $G$ on $X$ is equivalent to a group homomorphism $\varphi: G \to \operatorname{Sym}(X)$, where $\operatorname{Sym}(X)$ is the symmetric group on $X$ (the group of all bijections $X \to X$). The correspondence is $\varphi(g)(x) = g \cdot x$.

When $X$ is finite with $|X| = n$, we have $\operatorname{Sym}(X) \cong S_n$, so a $G$-action on an $n$-element set is a homomorphism $G \to S_n$.
</Definition>

## Fundamental Examples

<Example id="left-multiplication" title="Left multiplication (regular action)">
Every group $G$ acts on itself by left multiplication: $g \cdot x = gx$ for $g, x \in G$.

The corresponding homomorphism $\varphi: G \to \operatorname{Sym}(G)$ sends $g$ to the map $x \mapsto gx$. This homomorphism is injective (if $gx = x$ for all $x$, then $g = e$). This is precisely the content of **Cayley's Theorem**: every group embeds into a symmetric group.

For $G = \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} = \{0, 1, 2\}$, the element $1$ acts as the permutation $(0\;1\;2)$, and $2$ acts as $(0\;2\;1)$.
</Example>

<Example id="conjugation-action" title="Conjugation action">
Every group $G$ acts on itself by conjugation: $g \cdot x = gxg^{-1}$.

The identity axiom holds since $exe^{-1} = x$. For compatibility: $(gh) \cdot x = (gh)x(gh)^{-1} = g(hxh^{-1})g^{-1} = g \cdot (h \cdot x)$.

The corresponding homomorphism $\varphi: G \to \operatorname{Aut}(G)$ maps $g$ to the inner automorphism $\iota_g: x \mapsto gxg^{-1}$. The kernel of $\varphi$ is $\ker(\varphi) = \{g \in G : gxg^{-1} = x \text{ for all } x\} = Z(G)$, the center of $G$.

By the First Isomorphism Theorem, $G/Z(G) \cong \operatorname{Inn}(G) \leq \operatorname{Aut}(G)$.
</Example>

<Example id="conjugation-on-subgroups" title="Action on subgroups by conjugation">
$G$ acts on the set of all subgroups of $G$ by conjugation: $g \cdot H = gHg^{-1}$.

This is well-defined because $gHg^{-1}$ is always a subgroup when $H$ is. The stabilizer of $H$ under this action is the **normalizer** $N_G(H) = \{g \in G : gHg^{-1} = H\}$.

For $G = S_3$ and $H = \{e, (1\;2)\}$, the conjugate $(1\;3)H(1\;3)^{-1} = \{e, (1\;3)(1\;2)(1\;3)\} = \{e, (2\;3)\}$. So $H$ and $\{e, (2\;3)\}$ are in the same orbit.
</Example>

<Example id="dihedral-on-polygon" title="Dihedral group acting on vertices of a polygon">
The dihedral group $D_n$ (of order $2n$) acts on the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ of vertices of a regular $n$-gon. The rotation $r$ acts as the $n$-cycle $(1\;2\;3\;\cdots\;n)$, and a reflection $s$ acts as a permutation depending on $n$.

For $D_4$ (symmetries of a square) with vertices $\{1,2,3,4\}$: the rotation by $90°$ sends $1 \mapsto 2 \mapsto 3 \mapsto 4 \mapsto 1$, and one reflection sends $1 \mapsto 1$, $2 \mapsto 4$, $3 \mapsto 3$, $4 \mapsto 2$.

This gives an injective homomorphism $D_n \hookrightarrow S_n$.
</Example>

<Example id="matrix-on-vector-space" title="Linear group acting on a vector space">
The general linear group $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ acts on $\mathbb{R}^n$ by matrix multiplication: $A \cdot v = Av$ for $A \in GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ and $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$.

More generally, any group $G$ with a representation $\rho: G \to GL(V)$ acts on the vector space $V$ by $g \cdot v = \rho(g)(v)$. The study of group actions on vector spaces is the subject of **representation theory**.

For $G = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ acting on $\mathbb{R}^2$ via rotation by $2\pi/n$, the generator $1$ maps to the matrix $\left(\cos(2\pi/n), -\sin(2\pi/n); \sin(2\pi/n), \cos(2\pi/n)\right)$.
</Example>

<Example id="left-cosets" title="Action on cosets">
Let $H \leq G$ be a subgroup. Then $G$ acts on the set of left cosets $G/H = \{gH : g \in G\}$ by left multiplication: $g \cdot (aH) = (ga)H$.

This is well-defined: if $aH = bH$, then $gaH = gbH$. The corresponding homomorphism $\varphi: G \to \operatorname{Sym}(G/H)$ has kernel $\ker(\varphi) = \bigcap_{g \in G} gHg^{-1}$, which is the largest normal subgroup of $G$ contained in $H$.

This gives an important tool: if $[G : H] = n$, then there is a homomorphism $G \to S_n$, which allows us to study $G$ via its permutation action.
</Example>

## Types of Actions

<Definition title="Faithful action" number="3.4">
An action of $G$ on $X$ is **faithful** (or **effective**) if the corresponding homomorphism $\varphi: G \to \operatorname{Sym}(X)$ is injective. That is, the only element of $G$ that fixes every point of $X$ is the identity.

Equivalently, $\bigcap_{x \in X} \operatorname{Stab}_G(x) = \{e\}$.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Transitive action" number="3.5">
An action of $G$ on $X$ is **transitive** if for every pair $x, y \in X$, there exists $g \in G$ such that $g \cdot x = y$. Equivalently, there is only one orbit (the entire set $X$).
</Definition>

<Definition title="Free action" number="3.6">
An action of $G$ on $X$ is **free** if the only element of $G$ with a fixed point is the identity. That is, if $g \cdot x = x$ for some $x \in X$, then $g = e$.

Equivalently, $\operatorname{Stab}_G(x) = \{e\}$ for every $x \in X$.
</Definition>

<Example id="free-transitive" title="Free and transitive actions (torsors)">
The left multiplication action of $G$ on itself is both free and transitive. An action that is simultaneously free and transitive is called a **regular action** or a **$G$-torsor**.

The right multiplication action $x \cdot g = xg$ is also free and transitive. These two actions commute with each other, which is the essence of the regular representation.

If $G$ acts freely and transitively on $X$, then after choosing any point $x_0 \in X$, the map $G \to X$ given by $g \mapsto g \cdot x_0$ is a bijection. So $|X| = |G|$.
</Example>

<Example id="trivial-action" title="Trivial action">
The **trivial action** of $G$ on $X$ is defined by $g \cdot x = x$ for all $g \in G$ and $x \in X$. Every element fixes every point, so the corresponding homomorphism sends every element to the identity permutation.

This action is faithful only when $G$ is the trivial group. Every point is a fixed point, and every singleton forms an orbit.
</Example>

<Example id="faithful-not-free" title="Faithful but not free">
Consider $S_3$ acting on $\{1, 2, 3\}$ by permutation. This action is faithful (distinct permutations give distinct bijections) and transitive (any element can be sent to any other). However, it is not free: the transposition $(1\;2)$ fixes the element $3$.

In general, a transitive faithful action of $G$ on a set with $|X| < |G|$ cannot be free.
</Example>

<Example id="natural-action-sn" title="Natural action of S_n">
The symmetric group $S_n$ acts naturally on $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ by $\sigma \cdot i = \sigma(i)$. This action is faithful (by definition of $S_n$) and transitive (for any $i, j$ there exists a permutation sending $i$ to $j$).

The stabilizer of $n$ in $S_n$ is isomorphic to $S_{n-1}$ (permutations of $\{1, \ldots, n-1\}$ that fix $n$). The index is $[S_n : S_{n-1}] = n$, consistent with the orbit having $n$ elements.
</Example>

## Kernel and Fixed Points

<Definition title="Kernel of an action" number="3.7">
The **kernel** of an action of $G$ on $X$ is the kernel of the corresponding homomorphism $\varphi: G \to \operatorname{Sym}(X)$:

$$\ker(\text{action}) = \{g \in G : g \cdot x = x \text{ for all } x \in X\}.$$

The kernel is always a normal subgroup of $G$. The action is faithful if and only if the kernel is trivial.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Fixed point set" number="3.8">
For $g \in G$, the **fixed point set** of $g$ is $X^g = \{x \in X : g \cdot x = x\}$.

For a subgroup $H \leq G$, the **fixed point set** of $H$ is $X^H = \{x \in X : h \cdot x = x \text{ for all } h \in H\}$.
</Definition>

<Example id="fixed-points-conjugation" title="Fixed points of conjugation">
For the conjugation action of $G$ on itself, $g \cdot x = gxg^{-1}$:

The fixed point set of $g$ is $G^g = \{x \in G : gxg^{-1} = x\} = \{x \in G : gx = xg\} = C_G(g)$, the centralizer of $g$.

The fixed point set of all of $G$ is $G^G = \{x \in G : gxg^{-1} = x \text{ for all } g\} = Z(G)$, the center.

The kernel of the conjugation action is the center $Z(G)$, confirming that conjugation is faithful if and only if $Z(G) = \{e\}$ (i.e., $G$ is centerless).
</Example>

---

## $G$-Equivariant Maps

<Definition title="G-equivariant map (G-map)" number="3.9">
Let $X$ and $Y$ be $G$-sets. A function $f: X \to Y$ is **$G$-equivariant** (or a **$G$-map**) if $f(g \cdot x) = g \cdot f(x)$ for all $g \in G$ and $x \in X$.

A bijective $G$-equivariant map is called a **$G$-isomorphism**. The $G$-sets $X$ and $Y$ are **isomorphic** as $G$-sets if there exists a $G$-isomorphism between them.
</Definition>

<Example id="g-equivariant-example" title="Example of G-equivariant maps">
Let $G = S_3$ act on $X = \{1, 2, 3\}$ naturally, and act on $Y = \{\{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}\}$ (the set of 2-element subsets) by $\sigma \cdot S = \{\sigma(i) : i \in S\}$.

The map $f: X \to Y$ defined by $f(i) = \{1,2,3\} \setminus \{i\}$ (sending each element to the complementary pair) is $G$-equivariant: $f(\sigma(i)) = \{1,2,3\} \setminus \{\sigma(i)\} = \sigma(\{1,2,3\} \setminus \{i\}) = \sigma \cdot f(i)$.

Since $f$ is a bijection, $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic $S_3$-sets.
</Example>

## Summary

<Remark title="Key points">
The main ideas about group actions are:

1. A **group action** of $G$ on $X$ is the same as a homomorphism $G \to \operatorname{Sym}(X)$.

2. Key properties are **faithfulness** (injective homomorphism), **transitivity** (one orbit), and **freeness** (trivial stabilizers).

3. Standard actions include **left multiplication**, **conjugation**, and **action on cosets** $G/H$.

4. The **kernel** of an action is a normal subgroup; the action modulo the kernel is faithful.

5. Group actions provide a powerful tool for studying groups through their symmetries on sets, leading to orbit counting, Sylow theory, and classification results.
