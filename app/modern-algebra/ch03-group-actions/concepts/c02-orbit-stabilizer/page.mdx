# Orbits and Stabilizers

When a group $G$ acts on a set $X$, the set naturally partitions into **orbits** -- subsets of elements that can be reached from one another via the group action. The **stabilizer** of a point measures how much of the group leaves that point fixed. The fundamental Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem connects these two concepts, establishing that the size of an orbit equals the index of the stabilizer.

## Orbits

<Definition title="Orbit" number="3.10">
Let $G$ act on $X$. The **orbit** of an element $x \in X$ is the set

$$\operatorname{Orb}_G(x) = G \cdot x = \{g \cdot x : g \in G\}.$$

The orbit consists of all elements of $X$ that can be "reached" from $x$ by applying elements of $G$.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Orbit space" number="3.11">
The set of all orbits is called the **orbit space** and is denoted $X / G$ (or $G \backslash X$ for left actions, to distinguish from right cosets). The natural projection $\pi: X \to X/G$ sends each element to its orbit.
</Definition>

<Remark title="Orbits partition X">
The orbits of $G$ on $X$ form a partition of $X$. This follows from the fact that "being in the same orbit" defines an equivalence relation on $X$:

- **Reflexive**: $x = e \cdot x \in G \cdot x$.
- **Symmetric**: If $y = g \cdot x$, then $x = g^{-1} \cdot y$.
- **Transitive**: If $y = g \cdot x$ and $z = h \cdot y$, then $z = (hg) \cdot x$.

Therefore $X = \bigsqcup_{\text{orbits } \mathcal{O}} \mathcal{O}$, and $|X| = \sum_{\text{orbits}} |\mathcal{O}|$.
</Remark>

<Example id="orbits-rotation" title="Orbits of rotation action on a square">
Let $G = \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z} = \langle r \rangle$ act on the vertices $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ of a square by cyclic permutation: $r \cdot i = i + 1 \pmod{4}$.

There is exactly one orbit: $\operatorname{Orb}(1) = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, since $r^0 \cdot 1 = 1$, $r^1 \cdot 1 = 2$, $r^2 \cdot 1 = 3$, $r^3 \cdot 1 = 4$. The action is transitive.

Now consider the same group acting on the diagonals $\{\{1,3\}, \{2,4\}\}$. There is still one orbit of size 2: $r$ swaps the two diagonals, and $r^2$ fixes both.
</Example>

<Example id="orbits-s3-on-pairs" title="Orbits of S_3 on ordered pairs">
Let $S_3$ act on $\{1,2,3\}^2$ (ordered pairs) by $\sigma \cdot (i,j) = (\sigma(i), \sigma(j))$.

The orbits are determined by the "type" of the pair:
- **Diagonal pairs** $\{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)\}$: one orbit of size 3.
- **Off-diagonal pairs** $\{(1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2)\}$: one orbit of size 6.

So there are 2 orbits, of sizes 3 and 6, with $3 + 6 = 9 = |\{1,2,3\}^2|$.
</Example>

## Stabilizers

<Definition title="Stabilizer (isotropy subgroup)" number="3.12">
Let $G$ act on $X$. The **stabilizer** (or **isotropy subgroup**) of $x \in X$ is

$$\operatorname{Stab}_G(x) = G_x = \{g \in G : g \cdot x = x\}.$$

This is always a subgroup of $G$: the identity fixes $x$; if $g$ and $h$ fix $x$, then $gh$ fixes $x$; if $g$ fixes $x$, then $g^{-1}$ fixes $x$.
</Definition>

<Example id="stabilizer-conjugation" title="Stabilizer under conjugation">
For the conjugation action of $G$ on itself ($g \cdot x = gxg^{-1}$), the stabilizer of $x$ is

$$G_x = \{g \in G : gxg^{-1} = x\} = \{g \in G : gx = xg\} = C_G(x),$$

the **centralizer** of $x$ in $G$.

For $G = S_3$ and $x = (1\;2)$: the centralizer is $C_{S_3}((1\;2)) = \{e, (1\;2)\}$, since the only elements commuting with $(1\;2)$ are $e$ and $(1\;2)$ itself.
</Example>

<Example id="stabilizer-coset-action" title="Stabilizer in the coset action">
For the action of $G$ on left cosets $G/H$ by left multiplication, the stabilizer of the coset $gH$ is

$$\operatorname{Stab}_G(gH) = \{a \in G : a(gH) = gH\} = \{a \in G : g^{-1}ag \in H\} = gHg^{-1}.$$

In particular, the stabilizer of the identity coset $eH = H$ is $H$ itself. Stabilizers of different cosets are conjugates of $H$.
</Example>

<Example id="stabilizer-rotation" title="Stabilizers in D_4 acting on vertices">
Let $D_4 = \langle r, s \mid r^4 = s^2 = e, srs = r^{-1} \rangle$ act on the vertices $\{1,2,3,4\}$ of a square. Vertex 1 is fixed by $s$ (if $s$ is reflection through the axis passing through vertex 1) and by $e$, so $\operatorname{Stab}_{D_4}(1) = \{e, s\} \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.

The orbit of vertex 1 has size $|D_4|/|\operatorname{Stab}(1)| = 8/2 = 4$, confirming that all 4 vertices form one orbit.
</Example>

## The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem

<Theorem title="Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem" number="3.1">
Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $X$, and let $x \in X$. Then there is a bijection

$$G / G_x \xrightarrow{\;\sim\;} \operatorname{Orb}_G(x), \quad gG_x \mapsto g \cdot x.$$

In particular, if $G$ is finite, then

$$|\operatorname{Orb}_G(x)| = [G : G_x] = \frac{|G|}{|G_x|}.$$

Equivalently, $|G| = |\operatorname{Orb}_G(x)| \cdot |\operatorname{Stab}_G(x)|$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
Define $\phi: G/G_x \to \operatorname{Orb}(x)$ by $\phi(gG_x) = g \cdot x$.

**Well-defined**: If $gG_x = hG_x$, then $h^{-1}g \in G_x$, so $h^{-1}g \cdot x = x$, hence $g \cdot x = h \cdot x$.

**Injective**: If $g \cdot x = h \cdot x$, then $h^{-1}g \cdot x = x$, so $h^{-1}g \in G_x$, hence $gG_x = hG_x$.

**Surjective**: Every element of $\operatorname{Orb}(x)$ has the form $g \cdot x = \phi(gG_x)$.

So $\phi$ is a bijection. When $G$ is finite, $|G/G_x| = [G : G_x] = |G|/|G_x|$ by Lagrange's theorem.
</Proof>

<Example id="orbit-stabilizer-s4" title="S_4 acting on edges of a tetrahedron">
Let $S_4$ act on the 6 edges of a regular tetrahedron (with vertices $\{1,2,3,4\}$). An edge is a 2-element subset $\{i,j\}$, and $\sigma \cdot \{i,j\} = \{\sigma(i), \sigma(j)\}$.

The action is transitive (any edge can be sent to any other via an appropriate permutation). The stabilizer of the edge $\{1,2\}$ consists of permutations $\sigma$ with $\{\sigma(1), \sigma(2)\} = \{1,2\}$:

$$\operatorname{Stab}(\{1,2\}) = \{e, (1\;2), (3\;4), (1\;2)(3\;4)\} \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}.$$

By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem: $|\text{orbit}| = |S_4|/|\text{Stab}| = 24/4 = 6$, which matches the number of edges.
</Example>

<Example id="orbit-stabilizer-cube" title="Rotation group of a cube acting on faces">
The rotation group of the cube is isomorphic to $S_4$ (of order 24). It acts on the 6 faces of the cube. The action is transitive (any face can be rotated to any other face).

The stabilizer of the top face consists of the 4 rotations about the vertical axis: $\{0°, 90°, 180°, 270°\}$, a cyclic group of order 4.

By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem: $|\text{orbit}| = 24/4 = 6 = $ number of faces. Consistent.
</Example>

<Example id="orbit-stabilizer-z" title="Orbit-Stabilizer for a cyclic group">
Let $G = \mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$ act on $X = \mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$ by addition. The action is free and transitive, so every orbit has size 12 and every stabilizer is trivial.

Now consider $G = \mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$ acting on $X = \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ via the homomorphism $\varphi: \mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ given by reduction mod 4. The kernel is $\{0, 4, 8\}$, which is the stabilizer of every point. Each orbit has size $12/3 = 4$, so the action is transitive.
</Example>

## Counting Orbits

<Remark title="Orbit counting formula">
When $G$ is finite and acts on a finite set $X$, the partition into orbits gives

$$|X| = \sum_{\text{orbits } \mathcal{O}} |\mathcal{O}| = \sum_{\text{orbits}} [G : G_{x_{\mathcal{O}}}]$$

where $x_{\mathcal{O}}$ is any representative of the orbit $\mathcal{O}$. If we choose one representative from each orbit, we get

$$|X| = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{|G|}{|G_{x_i}|}$$

where $k$ is the number of orbits and $x_1, \ldots, x_k$ are the representatives.
</Remark>

<Example id="counting-orbits-d6" title="Orbits of D_3 on colorings">
Consider $D_3$ (symmetries of an equilateral triangle, order 6) acting on the set of 2-colorings of the 3 vertices (each vertex is colored black or white). There are $2^3 = 8$ colorings total.

The orbits are:
- All white: $\{WWW\}$ (size 1, stabilizer $D_3$).
- One black: $\{BWW, WBW, WWB\}$ (size 3, stabilizer of order 2).
- Two black: $\{BBW, BWB, WBB\}$ (size 3, stabilizer of order 2).
- All black: $\{BBB\}$ (size 1, stabilizer $D_3$).

Check: $1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8$. There are 4 orbits, corresponding to 4 "distinct" colorings up to symmetry.
</Example>

## Stabilizers of Points in the Same Orbit

<Theorem title="Conjugacy of stabilizers" number="3.2">
If $y = g \cdot x$, then $\operatorname{Stab}_G(y) = g \operatorname{Stab}_G(x) g^{-1}$.

In other words, stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are conjugate subgroups.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
Let $h \in \operatorname{Stab}_G(y)$. Then $h \cdot y = y$, so $h \cdot (g \cdot x) = g \cdot x$, hence $(g^{-1}hg) \cdot x = x$, so $g^{-1}hg \in \operatorname{Stab}_G(x)$, and therefore $h \in g\operatorname{Stab}_G(x)g^{-1}$. The reverse inclusion is similar.
</Proof>

<Example id="conjugate-stabilizers" title="Conjugate stabilizers in S_4">
Let $S_4$ act on $\{1,2,3,4\}$. The stabilizer of 1 is $\operatorname{Stab}(1) = S_{\{2,3,4\}} \cong S_3$. The stabilizer of 2 is $\operatorname{Stab}(2) = S_{\{1,3,4\}} \cong S_3$.

Since $1$ and $2$ are in the same orbit (the transposition $(1\;2)$ maps $1$ to $2$), the stabilizers are conjugate:

$$\operatorname{Stab}(2) = (1\;2) \cdot \operatorname{Stab}(1) \cdot (1\;2)^{-1}.$$

Indeed, conjugating $S_{\{2,3,4\}}$ by $(1\;2)$ replaces every occurrence of 1 with 2 and vice versa, giving $S_{\{1,3,4\}}$.
</Example>

## Fixed Points and the Fixed Point Counting Formula

<Definition title="Fixed point set" number="3.13">
For $g \in G$, the **fixed point set** of $g$ is $\operatorname{Fix}(g) = X^g = \{x \in X : g \cdot x = x\}$.
</Definition>

<Remark title="Relationship between fixed points and stabilizers">
There is a fundamental duality: $x \in \operatorname{Fix}(g)$ if and only if $g \in \operatorname{Stab}(x)$. In other words, the incidence relation "$g$ fixes $x$" can be viewed from either side.

This duality leads to the double-counting argument that underlies Burnside's Lemma.
</Remark>

<Example id="fixed-points-d4" title="Fixed points of each element of D_4">
Consider $D_4 = \{e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3\}$ acting on the 4 vertices of a square.

- $e$: fixes all 4 vertices. $|\operatorname{Fix}(e)| = 4$.
- $r$ (rotation by 90°): fixes no vertex. $|\operatorname{Fix}(r)| = 0$.
- $r^2$ (rotation by 180°): fixes no vertex. $|\operatorname{Fix}(r^2)| = 0$.
- $r^3$ (rotation by 270°): fixes no vertex. $|\operatorname{Fix}(r^3)| = 0$.
- $s$ (reflection through two vertices): fixes 2 vertices. $|\operatorname{Fix}(s)| = 2$.
- $sr^2$ (reflection through the other two vertices): fixes 2 vertices. $|\operatorname{Fix}(sr^2)| = 2$.
- $sr$ (reflection through midpoints of edges): fixes 0 vertices. $|\operatorname{Fix}(sr)| = 0$.
- $sr^3$ (reflection through midpoints of edges): fixes 0 vertices. $|\operatorname{Fix}(sr^3)| = 0$.

Sum: $4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 8 = |G| \times |\text{number of orbits}| = 8 \times 1$.
</Example>

## More Examples

<Example id="orbits-matrix-groups" title="Orbits of GL_2(R) on R^2">
The group $GL_2(\mathbb{R})$ acts on $\mathbb{R}^2$ by matrix multiplication. The orbits are:
- The origin $\{(0,0)\}$ (a single fixed point, orbit of size 1).
- The set $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\}$ (every nonzero vector can be sent to any other nonzero vector).

So there are exactly 2 orbits. The stabilizer of $v = (1, 0)^T$ is $\operatorname{Stab}(v) = \{A \in GL_2(\mathbb{R}) : Av = v\}$, which consists of matrices whose first column is $(1, 0)^T$, a group isomorphic to the affine group of the line.
</Example>

<Example id="orbits-modular" title="Orbits of Z/nZ acting on Z/nZ by addition">
Let $G = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ act on $X = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ by addition: $g \cdot x = g + x$. This action is free and transitive: every element has trivial stabilizer, and there is a single orbit (all of $X$).

If instead $G = \langle d \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}/(n/d)\mathbb{Z}$ (a subgroup generated by $d$ dividing $n$) acts on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, then the orbits are the cosets of $\langle d \rangle$, each of size $n/d$. There are $d$ orbits.
</Example>

## Summary

<Remark title="Key points">
The main ideas about orbits and stabilizers are:

1. **Orbits partition** $X$: every element belongs to exactly one orbit.

2. The **Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem** gives $|G| = |\operatorname{Orb}(x)| \cdot |\operatorname{Stab}(x)|$ for finite groups.

3. **Stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are conjugate** subgroups.

4. The **fixed point set** $\operatorname{Fix}(g)$ and the stabilizer are dual concepts, related by: $x \in \operatorname{Fix}(g) \iff g \in \operatorname{Stab}(x)$.

5. These concepts are the essential tools for the class equation, Sylow theorems, and Burnside's lemma.
