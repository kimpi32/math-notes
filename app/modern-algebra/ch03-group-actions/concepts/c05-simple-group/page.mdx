# Simple Groups

A simple group is a nontrivial group whose only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself. Simple groups are the "atoms" of group theory: by the Jordan--Holder theorem, every finite group can be decomposed into a sequence of simple groups (its composition factors), and this decomposition is unique up to reordering. The classification of finite simple groups, completed in the early 1980s, is one of the monumental achievements of mathematics.

## Definition

<Definition title="Simple group" number="3.20">
A group $G$ is **simple** if $G \neq \{e\}$ and the only normal subgroups of $G$ are $\{e\}$ and $G$ itself.

Equivalently, $G$ is simple if $|G| > 1$ and every surjective homomorphism $\varphi: G \to H$ is either an isomorphism (when $\ker \varphi = \{e\}$) or the trivial map (when $\ker \varphi = G$).
</Definition>

## Examples of Simple Groups

<Example id="cyclic-simple" title="Cyclic groups of prime order">
For a prime $p$, the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is simple. Its only subgroups are $\{0\}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ (by Lagrange's theorem, subgroup orders divide $p$, so must be 1 or $p$). Since the group is abelian, every subgroup is normal.

Conversely, if $G$ is a finite abelian simple group, then $G \cong \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for some prime $p$. (Any element of order $n > 1$ generates a cyclic subgroup, which is normal; for simplicity this must be all of $G$, so $G$ is cyclic of prime order.)

These are the only abelian simple groups.
</Example>

<Example id="a5-simple" title="A_5 is simple">
The alternating group $A_5$ (of order 60) is simple. This is the smallest non-abelian simple group.

**Proof sketch**: The conjugacy class sizes in $A_5$ are $1, 12, 12, 15, 20$ (corresponding to identity, two classes of 5-cycles, products of two disjoint transpositions, and 3-cycles).

A normal subgroup must be a union of conjugacy classes containing the identity. The possible sizes of such unions that divide 60 are: $1, 1+12=13, 1+15=16, 1+20=21, 1+12+12=25, \ldots$ None of these divide 60 except $1$ and $60$. So the only normal subgroups are $\{e\}$ and $A_5$.
</Example>

<Example id="an-simple" title="A_n is simple for n >= 5">
The alternating group $A_n$ is simple for all $n \geq 5$. The key steps in the proof are:

1. $A_n$ is generated by 3-cycles (for $n \geq 3$).
2. If $N \trianglelefteq A_n$ contains a 3-cycle, then $N$ contains all 3-cycles (since they are all conjugate in $A_n$ for $n \geq 5$), hence $N = A_n$.
3. Any nontrivial normal subgroup of $A_n$ must contain a 3-cycle.

The condition $n \geq 5$ is essential: $A_4$ is not simple (it has the normal subgroup $V_4 = \{e, (1\;2)(3\;4), (1\;3)(2\;4), (1\;4)(2\;3)\}$), and $A_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ is simple but abelian.
</Example>

<Example id="a4-not-simple" title="A_4 is not simple">
$A_4$ has order 12 and contains the Klein four-group $V_4 = \{e, (1\;2)(3\;4), (1\;3)(2\;4), (1\;4)(2\;3)\}$ as a normal subgroup. This can be verified directly: the set of all products of two disjoint transpositions forms a conjugacy class in $A_4$ of size 3, so $V_4$ (which is $\{e\}$ union this class) has size 4, and since it is a union of conjugacy classes, it is normal.

So $A_4$ is not simple. Its normal subgroups are $\{e\}$, $V_4$, and $A_4$.
</Example>

## Techniques for Proving Simplicity

<Example id="simplicity-via-sylow" title="Using Sylow theory to test simplicity">
A common strategy: if $|G| = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}$, compute the number $n_{p_i}$ of Sylow $p_i$-subgroups. If $n_p = 1$ for some prime $p$ dividing $|G|$, then the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup is normal, and $G$ is not simple (unless $G$ itself is a $p$-group of prime order).

**Example**: Let $|G| = 36 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2$. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups satisfies $n_3 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ and $n_3 \mid 4$, so $n_3 \in \{1, 4\}$. If $n_3 = 1$, the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, and $G$ is not simple.

If $n_3 = 4$, the action on the four Sylow 3-subgroups gives a homomorphism $G \to S_4$. Since $|G| = 36 > 24 = |S_4|$, the kernel is nontrivial, so $G$ has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. Either way, $G$ is not simple.

This proves that **no group of order 36 is simple**.
</Example>

<Example id="order-pq-not-simple" title="Groups of order pq are not simple">
Let $|G| = pq$ where $p < q$ are primes. By Sylow theory, $n_q \equiv 1 \pmod{q}$ and $n_q \mid p$. Since $p < q$, the only possibility is $n_q = 1$. The unique Sylow $q$-subgroup is normal.

Therefore, every group of order $pq$ with $p < q$ has a normal subgroup of order $q$, and hence is not simple (unless $p = 1$, which is impossible for primes).

Concretely, groups of order 6, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 26, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, ... are all non-simple.
</Example>

<Example id="order-12-not-simple" title="No group of order 12 is simple">
Let $|G| = 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$. Then $n_3 \in \{1, 4\}$.

If $n_3 = 1$: the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal, so $G$ is not simple.

If $n_3 = 4$: the action of $G$ on the four Sylow 3-subgroups gives $\varphi: G \to S_4$. Since $|G| = 12$ and $|S_4| = 24$, $\varphi$ could be injective. But $\varphi(G) \leq S_4$ has order dividing 12, so $\varphi(G) \cong A_4$ (the unique subgroup of $S_4$ of order 12). The kernel $\ker \varphi$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. If $\ker \varphi = \{e\}$, then $G \cong A_4$, which has normal subgroup $V_4$. Either way, $G$ is not simple.
</Example>

<Example id="index-trick" title="The index trick for simplicity">
If $G$ is a simple group and $H < G$ is a proper subgroup, then $|G|$ divides $[G:H]!$. This is because the action of $G$ on $G/H$ gives a homomorphism $G \to S_{[G:H]}$; if $G$ is simple and the action is nontrivial, the homomorphism is injective, so $|G|$ divides $|S_{[G:H]}| = [G:H]!$.

**Application**: $A_5$ (order 60) has no subgroup of index 2, 3, or 4, because $60$ does not divide $2! = 2$, $3! = 6$, or $4! = 24$. However, $60 \mid 5! = 120$, and indeed $A_5$ has a subgroup of index 5 (the stabilizer of a point, isomorphic to $A_4$).
</Example>

## Non-Simple Groups

<Example id="p-groups-not-simple" title="p-groups are not simple (except Z/pZ)">
If $G$ is a $p$-group with $|G| = p^n$ and $n \geq 2$, then $Z(G) \neq \{e\}$ and $Z(G) \neq G$ (unless $G$ is abelian, in which case any subgroup is normal). Either way, $G$ has a proper nontrivial normal subgroup.

More precisely, if $G$ is a non-abelian $p$-group, then $\{e\} \subsetneq Z(G) \subsetneq G$, so $Z(G)$ is a proper nontrivial normal subgroup. If $G$ is abelian of order $p^n$ with $n \geq 2$, it has a subgroup of order $p$ which is normal (all subgroups are normal in abelian groups).
</Example>

<Example id="solvable-not-simple" title="Solvable groups and simplicity">
A group $G$ is **solvable** if it has a subnormal series with abelian factors. The simple groups that are solvable are precisely $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for primes $p$.

So any finite solvable group of composite order is not simple. By Burnside's $p^a q^b$ theorem, any group of order $p^a q^b$ (for primes $p, q$) is solvable, and hence not simple unless it has prime order.

This gives another proof that groups of order $pq$, $p^2 q$, $p^2 q^2$, etc. are not simple.
</Example>

## The Classification of Finite Simple Groups

<Remark title="Overview of the classification">
The **Classification of Finite Simple Groups** (CFSG) states that every finite simple group is isomorphic to one of:

1. A **cyclic group** $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for a prime $p$.

2. An **alternating group** $A_n$ for $n \geq 5$.

3. A **group of Lie type**: these arise from simple Lie algebras over finite fields, including classical groups (such as $PSL_n(q)$, $PSp_{2n}(q)$, $PSO_n(q)$, $PSU_n(q)$) and exceptional groups (of types $G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8$ and their twisted variants).

4. One of 26 **sporadic groups**, which do not fit into any infinite family. These include the Mathieu groups ($M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{22}, M_{23}, M_{24}$), the Janko groups, the Conway groups, the Fischer groups, the Harada-Norton group, the Thompson group, the Baby Monster, and the Monster group (of order approximately $8 \times 10^{53}$).

The proof of the CFSG is spread across thousands of pages of journal articles by hundreds of mathematicians, completed around 1983.
</Remark>

<Example id="psl2-simple" title="PSL_2(q) is simple for q >= 4">
The projective special linear group $PSL_2(q) = SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q) / \{\pm I\}$ is simple for $q \geq 4$ (i.e., $q \neq 2, 3$).

- $PSL_2(4) \cong PSL_2(5) \cong A_5$, of order 60.
- $PSL_2(7) \cong GL_3(\mathbb{F}_2)$, of order 168 (the second smallest non-abelian simple group).
- $PSL_2(8)$ has order 504.
- $PSL_2(9) \cong A_6$, of order 360.

Note: $PSL_2(2) \cong S_3$ (order 6, not simple) and $PSL_2(3) \cong A_4$ (order 12, not simple).
</Example>

<Example id="small-simple" title="The smallest simple groups">
The non-abelian simple groups, listed by order:

| Order | Group |
|-------|-------|
| 60 | $A_5 \cong PSL_2(4) \cong PSL_2(5)$ |
| 168 | $PSL_2(7) \cong PSL_3(2)$ |
| 360 | $A_6 \cong PSL_2(9)$ |
| 504 | $PSL_2(8)$ |
| 660 | $PSL_2(11)$ |
| 1092 | $PSL_2(13)$ |
| 2448 | $PSL_2(17)$ |
| 2520 | $A_7$ |

Note that $A_5$ is the unique simple group of order 60.

## Composition Series and Simple Groups

<Definition title="Composition series" number="3.21">
A **composition series** of a group $G$ is a chain of subgroups

$$\{e\} = G_0 \trianglelefteq G_1 \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq G_n = G$$

such that each factor $G_{i+1}/G_i$ is simple. The factors $G_{i+1}/G_i$ are called **composition factors**.
</Definition>

<Example id="composition-s3" title="Composition series of S_3">
$S_3$ has a composition series: $\{e\} \trianglelefteq A_3 \trianglelefteq S_3$.

The composition factors are $A_3/\{e\} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ and $S_3/A_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, both simple.
</Example>

<Example id="composition-s4" title="Composition series of S_4">
$S_4$ has a composition series:

$$\{e\} \trianglelefteq V_4 \trianglelefteq A_4 \trianglelefteq S_4$$

Wait, $V_4$ is normal in $A_4$ and $A_4$ is normal in $S_4$, but $V_4$ is not simple ($V_4 \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ has proper normal subgroups). We must refine:

$$\{e\} \trianglelefteq \langle (1\;2)(3\;4) \rangle \trianglelefteq V_4 \trianglelefteq A_4 \trianglelefteq S_4.$$

The composition factors are: $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ (all cyclic of prime order, hence simple).
</Example>

<Example id="composition-z12" title="Composition series of Z/12Z">
$\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$ has several composition series:

$$\{0\} \trianglelefteq \langle 6 \rangle \trianglelefteq \langle 3 \rangle \trianglelefteq \langle 1 \rangle = \mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$$

with factors $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$.

Or: $\{0\} \trianglelefteq \langle 6 \rangle \trianglelefteq \langle 2 \rangle \trianglelefteq \mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$

with factors $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.

The composition factors are the same set $\{\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}\}$ regardless of the choice of series. This is the content of the Jordan--Holder theorem.
</Example>
