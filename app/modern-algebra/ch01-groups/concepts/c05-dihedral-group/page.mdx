# Dihedral Groups

The **dihedral group** $D_n$ is the symmetry group of a regular $n$-gon. It is one of the most concrete and important families of non-abelian groups, providing a rich source of examples for subgroups, normal subgroups, conjugacy classes, and group presentations.

## Definition

<Definition title="Dihedral group" number="1.13">
The **dihedral group** $D_n$ (for $n \geq 3$) is the group of symmetries (rotations and reflections) of a regular $n$-gon. It has order $|D_n| = 2n$ and consists of:

- $n$ **rotations**: $r^0 = e, r, r^2, \ldots, r^{n-1}$, where $r$ is rotation by $2\pi/n$
- $n$ **reflections**: $s, rs, r^2s, \ldots, r^{n-1}s$, where $s$ is a fixed reflection
</Definition>

<Remark title="Notation warning">
Some authors write $D_{2n}$ instead of $D_n$ for the dihedral group of order $2n$. We follow the convention where $D_n$ is the symmetry group of the regular $n$-gon, so $|D_n| = 2n$.
</Remark>

## Group Presentation

<Definition title="Presentation of D_n" number="1.14">
The dihedral group $D_n$ has the **presentation**:

$$D_n = \langle r, s \mid r^n = e, \; s^2 = e, \; srs = r^{-1} \rangle$$

The relation $srs = r^{-1}$ (equivalently, $sr = r^{-1}s$ or $rs = sr^{-1}$) captures the geometric fact that a reflection reverses the direction of rotation.
</Definition>

<Remark>
Every element of $D_n$ can be written uniquely as $r^i$ or $r^i s$ for $0 \leq i \leq n - 1$. The multiplication rules are:

- $r^i \cdot r^j = r^{i+j \bmod n}$
- $r^i s \cdot r^j = r^{i-j \bmod n} s$
- $r^i \cdot r^j s = r^{i+j \bmod n} s$
- $r^i s \cdot r^j s = r^{i-j \bmod n}$

These follow from the fundamental relation $sr^k = r^{-k}s$.
</Remark>

## Small Dihedral Groups

<Example id="d3" title="D_3: the triangle group">
$D_3$ is the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle. It has $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ elements.

Label the vertices 1, 2, 3. Then:

- $e$: identity
- $r = (1\;2\;3)$: rotation by $120°$
- $r^2 = (1\;3\;2)$: rotation by $240°$
- $s = (2\;3)$: reflection fixing vertex 1
- $rs = (1\;2)$: reflection fixing vertex 3 (rotation then reflection)
- $r^2s = (1\;3)$: reflection fixing vertex 2

As permutations, $D_3 \cong S_3$. This is the only case where $D_n \cong S_n$.
</Example>

<Example id="d4" title="D_4: the square group">
$D_4$ is the symmetry group of a square with vertices at positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (labeled clockwise). It has $2 \cdot 4 = 8$ elements:

**Rotations:**

- $e$: identity
- $r = (1\;2\;3\;4)$: rotation by $90°$
- $r^2 = (1\;3)(2\;4)$: rotation by $180°$
- $r^3 = (1\;4\;3\;2)$: rotation by $270°$

**Reflections:**

- $s = (2\;4)$: reflection across the vertical axis
- $rs = (1\;2)(3\;4)$: reflection across a diagonal
- $r^2s = (1\;3)$: reflection across the horizontal axis
- $r^3s = (1\;4)(2\;3)$: reflection across the other diagonal

$D_4$ is non-abelian: $rs \neq sr$. It has order 8, the same as $\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$, but $D_4$ is isomorphic to none of these.
</Example>

<Example id="d5" title="D_5: the pentagon group">
$D_5$ has $2 \cdot 5 = 10$ elements: 5 rotations and 5 reflections. Since 5 is odd, all reflections are conjugate to each other (they all have the same cycle type as permutations).

The subgroups of $D_5$ are:

- $\{e\}$ (order 1)
- Five subgroups of order 2: $\langle s \rangle$, $\langle rs \rangle$, $\langle r^2s \rangle$, $\langle r^3s \rangle$, $\langle r^4s \rangle$
- One subgroup of order 5: $\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$ (this is normal in $D_5$)
- $D_5$ itself (order 10)

Since 5 is prime, $\langle r \rangle$ has no proper non-trivial subgroups.
</Example>

<Example id="d6" title="D_6: the hexagon group">
$D_6$ has $2 \cdot 6 = 12$ elements. The rotation subgroup $\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$ has subgroups of orders 1, 2, 3, 6. The full subgroup lattice of $D_6$ is notably rich, including:

- The center $Z(D_6) = \{e, r^3\}$ (rotation by $180°$ commutes with everything)
- Three subgroups isomorphic to $D_3$ (symmetries of inscribed triangles)
- Three subgroups isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$
</Example>

## Properties of Dihedral Groups

<Theorem title="Center of D_n" number="1.22">
The center of $D_n$ is:

- $Z(D_n) = \{e\}$ if $n$ is odd
- $Z(D_n) = \{e, r^{n/2}\}$ if $n$ is even

In particular, $D_n$ is non-abelian for all $n \geq 3$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
An element $r^k$ commutes with $s$ iff $r^k s = s r^k$, i.e., $r^k s = r^{-k}s$, i.e., $r^{2k} = e$, i.e., $n \mid 2k$.

If $n$ is odd, this forces $n \mid k$, so $k = 0$ (only the identity). If $n$ is even, $k = 0$ or $k = n/2$.

No reflection $r^i s$ is central: $r(r^is) = r^{i+1}s$ but $(r^is)r = r^{i-1}s$, and $r^{i+1}s = r^{i-1}s$ iff $r^2 = e$ iff $n = 2$ (excluded since $n \geq 3$).
</Proof>

<Example id="center-d4" title="Center of D_4">
$Z(D_4) = \{e, r^2\} = \{e, (1\;3)(2\;4)\}$. The rotation by $180°$ commutes with all symmetries of the square. The quotient $D_4/Z(D_4)$ has order 4 and is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ (the Klein four-group).
</Example>

<Theorem title="Conjugacy classes of D_n" number="1.23">
The conjugacy classes of $D_n$ depend on the parity of $n$.

**For $n$ odd:**

- $\{e\}$
- $(n-1)/2$ classes of rotations: $\{r^k, r^{-k}\}$ for $k = 1, \ldots, (n-1)/2$
- One class of all $n$ reflections

**For $n$ even:**

- $\{e\}$ and $\{r^{n/2}\}$ (each a singleton)
- $(n-2)/2$ classes of rotations: $\{r^k, r^{-k}\}$ for $k = 1, \ldots, (n-2)/2$
- Two classes of reflections, each of size $n/2$
</Theorem>

<Example id="conjugacy-d4" title="Conjugacy classes of D_4">
$D_4$ has 5 conjugacy classes:

- $\{e\}$
- $\{r^2\}$ (the center)
- $\{r, r^3\}$ (rotations by $90°$ and $270°$)
- $\{s, r^2s\}$ (reflections across horizontal/vertical axes)
- $\{rs, r^3s\}$ (reflections across diagonals)

Sizes: $1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 = |D_4|$.
</Example>

## Subgroups and Normal Subgroups

<Example id="subgroups-d4" title="All subgroups of D_4">
$D_4$ has 10 subgroups:

**Order 1:** $\{e\}$

**Order 2:** $\langle r^2 \rangle$, $\langle s \rangle$, $\langle r^2s \rangle$, $\langle rs \rangle$, $\langle r^3s \rangle$

**Order 4:** $\langle r \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$, $\{e, r^2, s, r^2s\} \cong V_4$, $\{e, r^2, rs, r^3s\} \cong V_4$

**Order 8:** $D_4$

The normal subgroups are: $\{e\}$, $\langle r^2 \rangle$, $\langle r \rangle$, $\{e, r^2, s, r^2s\}$, $\{e, r^2, rs, r^3s\}$, and $D_4$ itself. Note that $\langle s \rangle$ is **not** normal: $r s r^{-1} = r^{-2}s \neq s$ (for $n \geq 3$).
</Example>

<Theorem title="Normal subgroups of D_n" number="1.24">
The rotation subgroup $\langle r \rangle$ is always normal in $D_n$ (it has index 2). Its subgroups are also normal in $D_n$ when $n$ is odd, but not necessarily when $n$ is even.
</Theorem>

## Dihedral Groups as Matrix Groups

<Example id="matrix-rep" title="D_n as a matrix group">
$D_n$ can be realized as a subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. Let $\theta = 2\pi/n$. Then:

- $r$ is the rotation matrix with entries $r_{11} = \cos\theta$, $r_{12} = -\sin\theta$, $r_{21} = \sin\theta$, $r_{22} = \cos\theta$
- $s$ is the reflection matrix with entries $s_{11} = 1$, $s_{12} = 0$, $s_{21} = 0$, $s_{22} = -1$

For $D_3$ (i.e., $n = 3$, $\theta = 2\pi/3$): $r$ has entries $r_{11} = -1/2$, $r_{12} = -\sqrt{3}/2$, $r_{21} = \sqrt{3}/2$, $r_{22} = -1/2$.

One can verify $r^3 = I$, $s^2 = I$, and $srs = r^{-1}$.
</Example>

## Dihedral Groups in Geometry

<Example id="symmetry-molecules" title="Molecular symmetry">
Dihedral groups appear in chemistry as symmetry groups of molecules:

- **Water** ($\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$): $D_1$ (one reflection plane — not really dihedral in our convention, but the concept)
- **Boron trifluoride** ($\mathrm{BF}_3$): $D_3$ (triangular planar)
- **Cyclopentadienyl** ($\mathrm{C}_5\mathrm{H}_5$): $D_5$ (pentagonal)
- **Benzene** ($\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_6$): $D_6$ (hexagonal)
</Example>

<Example id="wallpaper" title="Dihedral groups in tiling patterns">
Regular tilings of the plane have symmetry groups containing dihedral groups:

- The square tiling has local $D_4$ symmetry at each vertex
- The hexagonal tiling has local $D_6$ symmetry at each vertex
- The triangular tiling has local $D_6$ symmetry at each vertex (six triangles meet)
</Example>

<Example id="d-infinity" title="The infinite dihedral group">
$D_\infty = \langle r, s \mid s^2 = e, \; srs = r^{-1} \rangle$ (no relation $r^n = e$) is the **infinite dihedral group**. It is the symmetry group of the integer line $\mathbb{Z}$, with $r$ as translation by 1 and $s$ as reflection about 0.

$D_\infty$ is isomorphic to the semidirect product $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.
</Example>

---

## The Quaternion Group: A Contrast

<Example id="q8" title="The quaternion group Q_8">
The **quaternion group** $Q_8 = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}$ has order 8, like $D_4$. Its multiplication is governed by the rules $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$.

Although $|Q_8| = |D_4| = 8$, these groups are **not isomorphic**:

- In $D_4$, there are 5 elements of order 2 ($r^2$, $s$, $rs$, $r^2s$, $r^3s$).
- In $Q_8$, there is only 1 element of order 2 ($-1$).

$Q_8$ is the smallest group that is not isomorphic to any dihedral group or cyclic group.
</Example>

## Summary

The dihedral group $D_n$ concretely realizes abstract group theory through geometry: every axiom, every subgroup, every conjugacy class has a visible geometric meaning. The interplay between the cyclic rotation subgroup $\langle r \rangle$ and the reflection $s$ — captured by the relation $srs = r^{-1}$ — makes $D_n$ the prototypical example of a **semidirect product**. Understanding $D_n$ thoroughly provides essential intuition for the general theory of groups.
