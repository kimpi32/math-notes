# Product and Coproduct

Products and coproducts are the simplest non-trivial limits and colimits. They generalize the Cartesian product and disjoint union from $\mathbf{Set}$ to arbitrary categories, defined purely by their universal properties.

## Products

<Definition title="Product" number="2.4">
Let $A, B$ be objects in a category $\mathcal{C}$. A **product** of $A$ and $B$ is an object $A \times B$ together with morphisms $\pi_A : A \times B \to A$ and $\pi_B : A \times B \to B$ (called **projections**) satisfying the following universal property:

For every object $X$ and morphisms $f : X \to A$, $g : X \to B$, there exists a unique morphism $\langle f, g \rangle : X \to A \times B$ such that $\pi_A \circ \langle f, g \rangle = f$ and $\pi_B \circ \langle f, g \rangle = g$.

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
& X & \\
{}^{f}\swarrow & \downarrow\scriptstyle{\exists!\,\langle f,g\rangle} & \searrow^{g} \\
A & \xleftarrow{\pi_A} A \times B \xrightarrow{\pi_B} & B
\end{array}
$$
</Definition>

<Definition title="General product" number="2.5">
For a family of objects $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$, the **product** $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is an object with projections $\pi_j : \prod_i A_i \to A_j$ universal for compatible families: any family $f_j : X \to A_j$ factors uniquely through $\prod_i A_i$.
</Definition>

---

## Coproducts

<Definition title="Coproduct" number="2.6">
The **coproduct** of $A$ and $B$ is an object $A \sqcup B$ (or $A + B$, or $A \amalg B$) with morphisms $\iota_A : A \to A \sqcup B$ and $\iota_B : B \to A \sqcup B$ (called **coprojections** or **inclusions**) satisfying:

For every object $X$ and morphisms $f : A \to X$, $g : B \to X$, there exists a unique morphism $[f,g] : A \sqcup B \to X$ such that $[f,g] \circ \iota_A = f$ and $[f,g] \circ \iota_B = g$.
</Definition>

<Remark title="Duality">
The coproduct in $\mathcal{C}$ is the product in $\mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{op}}$. This is the first instance of categorical duality: every statement about products dualizes to a statement about coproducts by reversing all arrows.
</Remark>

## Examples

<Example title="Products in Set" id="prod-set">
In $\mathbf{Set}$, the product $A \times B$ is the Cartesian product $\{(a,b) : a \in A, b \in B\}$ with the usual projections. More generally, $\prod_{i \in I} A_i = \{(a_i)_{i \in I} : a_i \in A_i\}$ is the set of all choice functions.
</Example>

<Example title="Coproducts in Set" id="coprod-set">
In $\mathbf{Set}$, the coproduct $A \sqcup B$ is the disjoint union $A \sqcup B = \{(a, 0) : a \in A\} \cup \{(b, 1) : b \in B\}$. Given $f : A \to X$ and $g : B \to X$, the unique map $[f,g]$ acts as $f$ on elements from $A$ and $g$ on elements from $B$.
</Example>

<Example title="Products in Grp" id="prod-grp">
In $\mathbf{Grp}$, the product $G \times H$ is the direct product with componentwise operations: $(g_1, h_1) \cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1 g_2, h_1 h_2)$. The projections are the standard group homomorphisms.
</Example>

<Example title="Coproducts in Grp" id="coprod-grp">
In $\mathbf{Grp}$, the coproduct is the **free product** $G * H$: words alternating between elements of $G$ and $H$, subject only to the relations in $G$ and $H$ individually. For example, $\mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z} = F_2$ (the free group on 2 generators). The free product is typically much larger than the direct product.
</Example>

<Example title="Products and coproducts in Ab" id="prod-coprod-ab">
In $\mathbf{Ab}$, finite products and finite coproducts coincide: $A \times B \cong A \oplus B$ (the direct sum). The projections $A \oplus B \to A$ and inclusions $A \hookrightarrow A \oplus B$ make it both a product and a coproduct. For infinite families, the product $\prod_i A_i$ and coproduct $\bigoplus_i A_i$ differ: the coproduct consists of tuples with only finitely many nonzero entries.
</Example>

<Example title="Products in Top" id="prod-top">
In $\mathbf{Top}$, the product $X \times Y$ has the product topology (generated by products $U \times V$ of open sets). For arbitrary products $\prod_i X_i$, this is the product topology (coarsest topology making all projections continuous), not the box topology.
</Example>

<Example title="Coproducts in Top" id="coprod-top">
In $\mathbf{Top}$, the coproduct $\bigsqcup_i X_i$ is the disjoint union with the topology where $U \subseteq \bigsqcup_i X_i$ is open iff $U \cap X_i$ is open in $X_i$ for each $i$.
</Example>

<Example title="Products in a poset" id="prod-poset">
In a poset $(P, \leq)$ viewed as a category, the product of $a$ and $b$ is the greatest lower bound (meet, infimum) $a \wedge b$. The coproduct is the least upper bound (join, supremum) $a \vee b$. A category where all binary products and coproducts exist corresponds to a lattice.
</Example>

<Example title="Product of schemes" id="prod-scheme">
In $\mathbf{Sch}$, the product $X \times_S Y$ (fiber product over the base $S$) is the scheme representing $T \mapsto \mathrm{Hom}(T, X) \times_{\mathrm{Hom}(T, S)} \mathrm{Hom}(T, Y)$. For affine schemes, $\mathrm{Spec}\, A \times_{\mathrm{Spec}\, R} \mathrm{Spec}\, B = \mathrm{Spec}(A \otimes_R B)$.
</Example>

<Example title="Products in R-Mod" id="prod-rmod">
In $R\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}$, the product $\prod_{i \in I} M_i$ is the direct product (all tuples) and the coproduct $\bigoplus_{i \in I} M_i$ is the direct sum (finite support). When $I$ is finite, these coincide.
</Example>

<Example title="Coproduct in Ring" id="coprod-ring">
In $\mathbf{CRing}$, the coproduct is the tensor product: $A \sqcup B = A \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} B$. This is because $\mathrm{Hom}(A \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} B, C) \cong \mathrm{Hom}(A, C) \times \mathrm{Hom}(B, C)$ naturally. In $\mathbf{CRing}/R$ (the category of $R$-algebras), the coproduct is $A \otimes_R B$.
</Example>

<Example title="Category without products" id="no-products">
Not every category has products. In the category of fields $\mathbf{Field}$, the product $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{F}_p$ does not exist. If it did, there would be ring homomorphisms from a field to both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{F}_p$, which is impossible since they have different characteristics.
</Example>

## Relation to Hom

<Theorem title="Products via Hom" number="2.2">
An object $P$ with morphisms $\pi_i : P \to A_i$ is a product $\prod_i A_i$ if and only if for every $X$:

$$\mathrm{Hom}(X, P) \cong \prod_{i \in I} \mathrm{Hom}(X, A_i)$$

naturally in $X$. Dually, $Q$ with $\iota_i : A_i \to Q$ is a coproduct if and only if $\mathrm{Hom}(Q, X) \cong \prod_i \mathrm{Hom}(A_i, X)$ naturally in $X$.
</Theorem>

<Remark title="Looking ahead">
Products and coproducts are special cases of [limits and colimits](/category-theory/ch02-limits-colimits/concepts/c04-limit-colimit) — they are limits over discrete diagrams. Together with [equalizers](/category-theory/ch02-limits-colimits/theorems/t02-limits-via-products-equalizers), products suffice to construct all limits. The existence of all products and equalizers in a category is equivalent to the existence of all (small) limits.
