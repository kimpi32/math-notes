# Injective/Projective Resolution

Injective and projective resolutions are the workhorses of homological algebra. They replace arbitrary objects by complexes of well-behaved objects (injective or projective), allowing us to compute derived functors. The key insight is that while the resolution is not unique, the cohomology of the result is independent of the choice.

## Injective and Projective Objects

<Definition title="Injective Object" number="7.1">
An object $I$ in an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ is **injective** if the functor $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(-, I)$ is exact. Equivalently, for every monomorphism $f : A \hookrightarrow B$ and every morphism $g : A \to I$, there exists a morphism $h : B \to I$ such that $h \circ f = g$.

$$A \xhookrightarrow{f} B \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \exists\, h : B \to I \text{ with } h \circ f = g$$
</Definition>

<Definition title="Projective Object" number="7.2">
An object $P$ in an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ is **projective** if the functor $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(P, -)$ is exact. Equivalently, for every epimorphism $f : B \twoheadrightarrow C$ and every morphism $g : P \to C$, there exists a morphism $h : P \to B$ such that $f \circ h = g$.

$$B \twoheadrightarrow C \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \exists\, h : P \to B \text{ with } f \circ h = g$$
</Definition>

## Resolutions

<Definition title="Injective Resolution" number="7.3">
An **injective resolution** of an object $A \in \mathcal{A}$ is an exact sequence

$$0 \to A \xrightarrow{\varepsilon} I^0 \xrightarrow{d^0} I^1 \xrightarrow{d^1} I^2 \to \cdots$$

where each $I^n$ is injective. Equivalently, it is a quasi-isomorphism $A[0] \xrightarrow{\sim} I^\bullet$ where $I^\bullet$ is a complex of injective objects concentrated in non-negative degrees.
</Definition>

<Definition title="Projective Resolution" number="7.4">
A **projective resolution** of an object $A \in \mathcal{A}$ is an exact sequence

$$\cdots \to P_2 \xrightarrow{d_2} P_1 \xrightarrow{d_1} P_0 \xrightarrow{\varepsilon} A \to 0$$

where each $P_n$ is projective. Equivalently, it is a quasi-isomorphism $P_\bullet \xrightarrow{\sim} A[0]$ where $P_\bullet$ is a complex of projective objects concentrated in non-positive degrees.
</Definition>

## Existence

<Definition title="Enough Injectives" number="7.5">
An abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ has **enough injectives** if for every object $A$, there exists a monomorphism $A \hookrightarrow I$ with $I$ injective. Dually, $\mathcal{A}$ has **enough projectives** if for every object $A$, there exists an epimorphism $P \twoheadrightarrow A$ with $P$ projective.
</Definition>

<Theorem title="Existence of resolutions" number="7.1">
If $\mathcal{A}$ has enough injectives, then every object $A \in \mathcal{A}$ admits an injective resolution. If $\mathcal{A}$ has enough projectives, then every object $A$ admits a projective resolution.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
We construct an injective resolution inductively. Since $\mathcal{A}$ has enough injectives, embed $A \hookrightarrow I^0$ with $I^0$ injective. Set $C^0 = \mathrm{coker}(A \to I^0)$. Then embed $C^0 \hookrightarrow I^1$ with $I^1$ injective. Set $C^1 = \mathrm{coker}(C^0 \to I^1)$. Continue: at each step, embed $C^{n-1} \hookrightarrow I^n$ and set $C^n = \mathrm{coker}(C^{n-1} \to I^n)$. The resulting complex $0 \to A \to I^0 \to I^1 \to \cdots$ is exact by construction. The projective case is dual.
</Proof>

## Comparison Lemma

<Theorem title="Comparison Lemma" number="7.2">
Let $f : A \to B$ be a morphism in $\mathcal{A}$. Let $P_\bullet \to A$ be a projective resolution and $Q_\bullet \to B$ any resolution (not necessarily projective). Then there exists a chain map $\tilde{f} : P_\bullet \to Q_\bullet$ lifting $f$, and any two such lifts are chain homotopic.

Dually, if $A \to I^\bullet$ is an injective resolution and $B \to J^\bullet$ any resolution, then $f$ lifts to a chain map $\tilde{f} : I^\bullet \to J^\bullet$, unique up to homotopy.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
We construct $\tilde{f}$ inductively. In degree 0, the map $P_0 \to A \xrightarrow{f} B$ composed with $B \leftarrow Q_0$ needs a lift. Since $Q_0 \twoheadrightarrow B$ is surjective and $P_0$ is projective, a lift $\tilde{f}_0 : P_0 \to Q_0$ exists. For the inductive step, one restricts to the kernel of the previous augmentation and uses projectivity again. The homotopy uniqueness is similarly proved by induction using projectivity to construct the null-homotopy components.
</Proof>

## Examples

<Example title="Free resolution of Z/nZ" id="free-zn">
Over $R = \mathbb{Z}$, the module $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ has the projective (free) resolution

$$0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\cdot n} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \to 0$$

This is the simplest non-trivial projective resolution: two terms, with the map being multiplication by $n$.
</Example>

<Example title="Injective resolution of Z" id="inj-z">
Over $\mathbb{Z}$, the module $\mathbb{Z}$ has the injective resolution

$$0 \to \mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} \to 0$$

Here $\mathbb{Q}$ is injective (divisible abelian group), and $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is also injective (divisible). This terminates in two steps because $\mathbb{Z}$ has global dimension 1.
</Example>

<Example title="Projective resolution over k[x]" id="proj-kx">
Over $R = k[x]$, the module $k = k[x]/(x)$ has the projective resolution

$$0 \to k[x] \xrightarrow{\cdot x} k[x] \to k \to 0$$

Since $k[x]$ is a PID, every module has a projective resolution of length at most 1.
</Example>

<Example title="Koszul resolution" id="koszul">
Over $R = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, the residue field $k = R/(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ has the **Koszul resolution**

$$0 \to R \to R^n \to R^{\binom{n}{2}} \to \cdots \to R^n \to R \to k \to 0$$

The $i$-th term is $\bigwedge^{n-i} R^n$, a free module of rank $\binom{n}{n-i}$. This resolution has length $n$, reflecting the Krull dimension.
</Example>

<Example title="Bar resolution of a group" id="bar-resolution">
For a group $G$ with group ring $\mathbb{Z}[G]$, the trivial module $\mathbb{Z}$ has the **bar resolution**

$$\cdots \to \mathbb{Z}[G^3] \to \mathbb{Z}[G^2] \to \mathbb{Z}[G] \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0$$

with differentials $d_n(g_0, \ldots, g_n) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^i (g_0, \ldots, \hat{g}_i, \ldots, g_n)$. This is a free $\mathbb{Z}[G]$-resolution, and its cohomology computes group cohomology $H^n(G, M)$.
</Example>

<Example title="Injective objects in Ab" id="inj-ab">
An abelian group $I$ is injective if and only if it is **divisible**: for every $n \geq 1$ and every $x \in I$, there exists $y \in I$ with $ny = x$. Examples include $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$, and $\mathbb{Z}[p^{-1}]/\mathbb{Z}$ for any prime $p$.
</Example>

<Example title="Projective objects in Ab" id="proj-ab">
In the category of abelian groups, the projective objects are exactly the free abelian groups. Every abelian group $A$ admits a surjection $\mathbb{Z}^{(S)} \twoheadrightarrow A$ from a free group, so $\mathbf{Ab}$ has enough projectives.
</Example>

<Example title="Injective hull" id="inj-hull">
Every module $M$ over a Noetherian ring has an **injective hull** (or injective envelope) $E(M)$, which is the smallest injective module containing $M$ as an essential submodule. For example, $E(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}[p^{-1}]/\mathbb{Z}$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$-module, the Prüfer $p$-group.
</Example>

<Example title="Minimal free resolution" id="minimal">
Over a local ring $(R, \mathfrak{m}, k)$, a **minimal free resolution** of a finitely generated module $M$ is one where each differential satisfies $d(P_n) \subseteq \mathfrak{m} P_{n-1}$. The ranks of the free modules are the **Betti numbers** $\beta_n(M) = \dim_k \mathrm{Tor}_n^R(M, k)$. Minimal resolutions are unique up to isomorphism.
</Example>

<Example title="No projective objects in sheaves" id="no-proj-sheaves">
The category $\mathbf{Sh}(X)$ of sheaves on a general topological space $X$ typically has **no** nonzero projective objects. However, it always has enough injectives (via Godement resolution). This is why sheaf cohomology uses injective resolutions rather than projective ones.
</Example>

<Example title="Horseshoe lemma" id="horseshoe">
Given a short exact sequence $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$ with projective resolutions $P_\bullet \to A$ and $Q_\bullet \to C$, the **horseshoe lemma** constructs a projective resolution of $B$ of the form $P_\bullet \oplus Q_\bullet$ (as graded modules, with a modified differential). This is essential for the long exact sequence of derived functors.
</Example>

<Example title="Acyclic resolution" id="acyclic">
A resolution $0 \to A \to F^0 \to F^1 \to \cdots$ where each $F^n$ is $F$-acyclic (meaning $R^iF(F^n) = 0$ for $i > 0$) suffices to compute $R^nF(A)$. For example, flasque sheaves are $\Gamma$-acyclic, so the Godement resolution (which consists of flasque sheaves) computes sheaf cohomology without being an injective resolution.
</Example>

## Key Properties

<Theorem title="Properties of injective and projective objects" number="7.3">
1. Every direct summand of an injective object is injective.
2. Every direct summand of a projective object is projective.
3. A product of injective objects is injective.
4. A coproduct of projective objects is projective.
5. In $R\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}$, $P$ is projective if and only if $P$ is a direct summand of a free module.
</Theorem>

<Remark title="Duality between injective and projective">
Injective and projective objects are formally dual: passing to the opposite category $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{op}}$, injective objects become projective and vice versa. However, the existence of enough injectives and enough projectives are independent conditions. Module categories over rings have both; categories of sheaves typically have enough injectives but not enough projectives.
</Remark>

<Remark title="Role in derived categories">
In the derived category $D^+(\mathcal{A})$, every object is isomorphic to its injective resolution (when $\mathcal{A}$ has enough injectives). The comparison lemma ensures this is well-defined. This is the bridge between the classical approach (compute derived functors via resolutions) and the modern approach (work directly in the derived category).
