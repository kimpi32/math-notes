# Abelian Category

An abelian category is the natural setting for homological algebra. It axiomatizes the properties of module categories that make diagram chasing, exact sequences, and derived functors possible. The Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem guarantees that every small abelian category embeds into a module category, so element-wise arguments remain valid.

## Definition

<Definition title="Abelian Category" number="3.4">
An additive category $\mathcal{A}$ is **abelian** if:

1. Every morphism has a [kernel and a cokernel](/category-theory/ch03-abelian-categories/concepts/c03-kernel-cokernel).
2. Every monomorphism is the kernel of some morphism (equivalently, of its cokernel).
3. Every epimorphism is the cokernel of some morphism (equivalently, of its kernel).
</Definition>

<Remark title="Equivalent formulations">
Condition (2) can be rephrased: the canonical morphism $\mathrm{coim}\, f \to \mathrm{im}\, f$ is an isomorphism for every morphism $f$. Here $\mathrm{coim}\, f = \mathrm{coker}(\ker f)$ and $\mathrm{im}\, f = \ker(\mathrm{coker}\, f)$.
</Remark>

<Definition title="Grothendieck Category" number="3.5">
An abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ is a **Grothendieck category** if:

1. $\mathcal{A}$ is cocomplete (has all small colimits).
2. Filtered colimits are exact (the AB5 condition).
3. $\mathcal{A}$ has a generator.

Grothendieck categories have enough injectives, making them ideal for derived functor theory.
</Definition>

## Examples

<Example title="R-Mod is abelian" id="rmod-abelian">
For any ring $R$, the category $R\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}$ of left $R$-modules is abelian. Kernels and cokernels are the usual module-theoretic ones, and monomorphisms/epimorphisms correspond to injective/surjective homomorphisms. It is also a Grothendieck category with generator $R$.
</Example>

<Example title="Ab is abelian" id="ab-abelian">
$\mathbf{Ab} = \mathbb{Z}\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}$ is abelian. It is the prototypical abelian category and a Grothendieck category with generator $\mathbb{Z}$.
</Example>

<Example title="Vect_k is abelian" id="vect-abelian">
$\mathbf{Vect}_k$ is abelian: every linear map has a kernel (null space) and cokernel (quotient by the image). Every injective map is a kernel, and every surjective map is a cokernel.
</Example>

<Example title="Sheaves of abelian groups" id="sheaves-abelian">
For a topological space $X$, the category $\mathbf{Sh}(X)$ of sheaves of abelian groups on $X$ is abelian. Kernels are computed as presheaf kernels; cokernels require sheafification. $\mathbf{Sh}(X)$ is a Grothendieck category.
</Example>

<Example title="Coherent sheaves on a scheme" id="coh-abelian">
For a Noetherian scheme $X$, $\mathbf{Coh}(X)$ (coherent sheaves) is abelian. The category $\mathbf{QCoh}(X)$ of quasi-coherent sheaves is a Grothendieck abelian category.
</Example>

<Example title="Functor category into an abelian category" id="functor-abelian">
If $\mathcal{A}$ is abelian and $\mathcal{C}$ is small, then the functor category $[\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{A}]$ is abelian with pointwise kernels, cokernels, and exact sequences.
</Example>

<Example title="Ch(A) is abelian" id="ch-abelian">
If $\mathcal{A}$ is abelian, then the category of chain complexes $\mathbf{Ch}(\mathcal{A})$ is abelian. Kernels and cokernels are computed degreewise: $(\ker f)^n = \ker(f^n)$ and $(\mathrm{coker}\, f)^n = \mathrm{coker}(f^n)$.
</Example>

<Example title="Category of finite abelian groups" id="finab-abelian">
$\mathbf{FinAb}$ is abelian. However, it is NOT a Grothendieck category (it does not have all small coproducts: the direct sum of infinitely many copies of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is not a finite group).
</Example>

<Example title="Grp is NOT abelian" id="grp-not-abelian">
$\mathbf{Grp}$ is not abelian. The cokernel of $f : H \to G$ is $G/N(f(H))$ (quotient by the normal closure), but not every monomorphism is a kernel: the inclusion $A_3 \hookrightarrow S_3$ is monic but is not the kernel of any homomorphism out of $S_3$ (since $A_3$ is normal, it is, but this fails for non-normal subgroups like $\{e, (12)\} \hookrightarrow S_3$).
</Example>

<Example title="Top is NOT abelian" id="top-not-abelian">
$\mathbf{Top}$ is not even additive (no abelian group structure on hom-sets), hence far from abelian.
</Example>

<Example title="Opposite of an abelian category is abelian" id="op-abelian">
If $\mathcal{A}$ is abelian, then $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{op}}$ is abelian. Kernels in $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{op}}$ are cokernels in $\mathcal{A}$, and vice versa. This gives the principle of **abelian duality**: every theorem in an abelian category has a dual.
</Example>

<Example title="Representations of a quiver" id="quiver-rep">
For a quiver $Q$ and a field $k$, the category $\mathrm{Rep}_k(Q)$ of finite-dimensional representations is abelian. It is equivalent to $\mathrm{mod}\text{-}kQ$ (finitely generated modules over the path algebra), hence abelian by the general theory.
</Example>

## Key Properties

<Theorem title="Properties of abelian categories" number="3.2">
In an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$:

1. A morphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is both monic and epic.
2. Every morphism $f : A \to B$ factors as $A \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{im}\, f \rightarrowtail B$.
3. The [Snake Lemma](/category-theory/ch03-abelian-categories/theorems/t01-snake-lemma) and [Five Lemma](/category-theory/ch03-abelian-categories/theorems/t02-five-lemma) hold.
4. Finite limits and colimits exist and can be expressed in terms of kernels, cokernels, and biproducts.
</Theorem>

<Remark title="The Freyd-Mitchell embedding">
The [Freyd-Mitchell Embedding Theorem](/category-theory/ch03-abelian-categories/theorems/t03-freyd-mitchell) states that every small abelian category admits an exact, fully faithful embedding into $R\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}$ for some ring $R$. This means that diagram chasing with elements is always valid in small abelian categories — a crucial tool for homological algebra.
</Remark>

<Remark title="Looking ahead">
Abelian categories are the starting point for:
- [Exact sequences](/category-theory/ch03-abelian-categories/concepts/c04-exact-sequence) and homological algebra
- [Chain complexes](/category-theory/ch04-complexes-cohomology/concepts/c01-chain-complex) and cohomology
- [Derived categories](/category-theory/ch06-derived-categories/concepts/c01-derived-category) and derived functors
